O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva (Foto: Aloisio Mauricio / Fotoarena)A Pol&#237;cia Federal indiciou o ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva pelo crime de corrup&#231;&#227;o em raz&#227;o de evid&#234;ncias de propina de R$ 20 milh&#245;es mascarada em contratos da empreiteira Odebrecht,&#160;em Angola, firmados com a empresa Exergia, cujo s&#243;cio era Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, seu sobrinho.Lula foi indiciado por corrup&#231;&#227;o passiva, porque a PF concluiu que os contratos de Taiguara s&#243; aconteceram em raz&#227;o do parentesco e das rela&#231;&#245;es da empreiteira com Lula, al&#233;m dos documentos que citam o pr&#243;prio ex-presidente no neg&#243;cio. Seu sobrinho e sete executivos da empreiteira, incluindo Marcelo Odebrecht, foram indiciados por corrup&#231;&#227;o e lavagem.Leia tamb&#233;m:&gt;&gt;&#160;As opera&#231;&#245;es suspeitas da Odebrecht em Angola&gt;&gt; Palocci, o Italiano, a Odebrecht e o PTO indiciamento ocorreu ap&#243;s cinco meses de investiga&#231;&#227;o da Opera&#231;&#227;o Janus, que devassou contratos da empreiteira com a empresa Exergia. Em maio, a PF, com autoriza&#231;&#227;o da Justi&#231;a, cumpriu mandados de busca e apreens&#227;o em endere&#231;os de Taiguara em Santos. Era uma mina de ouro para a investiga&#231;&#227;o. A PF descobriu que Lula recebia tr&#234;s alcunhas nas conversas: tio, presidente e &#8220;chefe maior&#8221;.Uma das provas apreendidas pela PF era uma esp&#233;cie de di&#225;rio no computador do sobrinho de Lula, com diversos relatos da empresa e do petista. Eram textos em formato .doc, com Taiguara falando de si mesmo em terceira pessoa. Um dos primeiros &#8211; e mais relevantes &#8211; registros desse di&#225;rio &#233; de 2009, quando Taiguara descreve uma reuni&#227;o. Ele diz que esteve em Bras&#237;lia para conversar com o tio. Registrou at&#233; a dura&#231;&#227;o do encontro: 50 minutos. Taiguara resumiu a resposta de Lula dizendo que ele deu &#8220;carta branca&#8221; para os neg&#243;cios em Angola.Ap&#243;s esse encontro, com o aval de Lula, Taiguara preparou sua empresa para arrancar um naco dos contratos bilion&#225;rios da Odebrecht em Angola, financiados com dinheiro do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social). Como &#201;POCA revelou no ano passado, Lula fazia lobby para a empreiteira sob o pretexto de palestras, usando o status de ex-presidente para viabilizar obras fora do pa&#237;s bancadas pelo banco estatal.Pagamento da Odebrecht para a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)Contrato da Odebrecht com a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)O tio resolveAl&#233;m do di&#225;rio, a PF conseguiu recuperar mensagens de WhatsApp enviadas por Taiguara. Um dos destinat&#225;rios favoritos era um seguran&#231;a do ex-presidente Lula, de nome Valmir Morais. Funcion&#225;rio da Presid&#234;ncia da Rep&#250;blica, ele acompanhava Lula ap&#243;s o mandato. Como &#201;POCA revelou no in&#237;cio deste ano, Valmir era um dos seguran&#231;as que foram 111 vezes a Atibaia, no s&#237;tio que Lula diz n&#227;o ser dele. A PF descobriu que o seguran&#231;a era, tamb&#233;m, um homem de recados do ex-presidente, que n&#227;o usava celular. Numa das mensagens, Taiguara disse que havia chegado de Angola e precisava, com urg&#234;ncia, de uma reuni&#227;o com o tio.Outro lote de mensagens era com um parceiro de Taiguara em sua empresa, a Exergia. O conte&#250;do das conversas era expl&#237;cito. Numa delas, Taiguara fala que um projeto com a Odebrecht era uma fic&#231;&#227;o &#8211; o contrato depois foi firmado. Em outra, j&#225; em 2015, eles reclamavam das dificuldades em fechar neg&#243;cios. Na ocasi&#227;o, a Lava Jato j&#225; tinha atingido a empreiteira. Taiguara, de novo, ia direto ao ponto: ia falar com o tio para resolver os impasses com a Odebrecht.&#160;No total, foram 16 contratos da Odebrecht com a empresa de Taiguara, uma parceria pr&#243;spera, longa e diversificada. A conclus&#227;o da PF &#233; contundente: a empresa foi criada apenas para receber dinheiro da empreiteira, sem prestar servi&#231;os. N&#227;o havia outros clientes ou ind&#237;cios de qualquer servi&#231;o executado. Sobram, contudo, documentos que mostram uma gastan&#231;a de Taiguara, incluindo outros familiares de Lula, que tinham at&#233; o plano de sa&#250;de pago com o dinheiro da Exergia. Havia, claro, itens de luxo, como roupas e carros.Conforme os documentos eram analisados, a investiga&#231;&#227;o avan&#231;ava. Uma per&#237;cia concluiu pela &#8220;incapacidade t&#233;cnica e operacional&#8221; da Exergia. Soma-se a um documento interno da Odebrecht, que qualificava o servi&#231;o contratado de &#8220;imprest&#225;vel&#8221;. A conclus&#227;o da PF foi uma s&#243;: era imposs&#237;vel a nanica empresa de Santos executar as obras milion&#225;rias em Angola.As mensagens de Taiguara citando Lula n&#227;o eram mera bravata de um familiar se aproveitando do status de um parente famoso. A investiga&#231;&#227;o descobriu ainda diversas reuni&#245;es de Taiguara no Instituto Lula. Houve, tamb&#233;m, um encontro num hotel cinco estrelas em Angola. O primeiro ind&#237;cio surgiu de uma mensagem do pr&#243;prio Taiguara a um seguran&#231;a de Lula. Ele pedia um encontro, informava que estava no mesmo hotel do tio e citava o quarto. Lula esteve l&#225; duas vezes, sob o pretexto de dar palestras. As duas foram pagas pela Odebrecht.O empres&#225;rio Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, filho do irm&#227;o da primeira mulher de Lula, em depoimento &#224; CPI do BNDES em outubro de 2015 (Foto: Lucio Bernardo Junior / C&#226;mara dos Deputados)Procurada, a defesa de Lula enviou a seguinte nota por meio do Instituto Lula:O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva tem sua vida investigada h&#225; 40 anos, teve todas as suas contas e de seus familiares devassadas, seu sigilo banc&#225;rio, fiscal e telef&#244;nico quebrado&#160; e n&#227;o foi encontrada nenhuma irregularidade. Lula n&#227;o ocupa mais nenhum cargo p&#250;blico desde 1&#186; de janeiro de 2011, e sempre agiu dentro da lei antes, durante e depois de ocupar dois mandatos eleitos como presidente da Rep&#250;blica. A defesa do ex-presidente ir&#225; analisar o documento da Pol&#237;cia Federal, vazado para a imprensa e divulgado com sensacionalismo antes do acesso da defesa, porque essa pr&#225;tica deixa claro que n&#227;o s&#227;o processos s&#233;rios de investiga&#231;&#227;o, e sim uma campanha de massacre midi&#225;tico para produzir manchetes na imprensa e tentar destruir a imagem do ex-presidente mais popular da hist&#243;ria do pa&#237;s.&#160;&#201;POCA ainda n&#227;o localizou os advogados de Taiguara, mas t&#227;o logo obtenha um posicionamento atualizar&#225; esta reportagem para contemplar adequadamente a vers&#227;o dos citados. Na CPI do BNDES, ele disse que n&#227;o houve influ&#234;ncia de Lula no neg&#243;cio.No papel, Taiguara nem sequer &#233; sobrinho de Lula. Ele &#233; filho de Jacinto Ribeiro dos Santos, o Lambari, amigo de Lula e irm&#227;o da primeira mulher do ex-presidente, j&#225; morta. Mas o parentesco a&#237; se deu por afinidade. E a Odebrecht cimentou essa rela&#231;&#227;o.

Seu sobrinho e sete executivos da empreiteira, incluindo Marcelo Odebrecht, foram indiciados por corrup&#231;&#227;o e lavagem.Leia tamb&#233;m:&gt;&gt;&#160;As opera&#231;&#245;es suspeitas da Odebrecht em Angola&gt;&gt; Palocci, o Italiano, a Odebrecht e o PTO indiciamento ocorreu ap&#243;s cinco meses de investiga&#231;&#227;o da Opera&#231;&#227;o Janus, que devassou contratos da empreiteira com a empresa Exergia. Em maio, a PF, com autoriza&#231;&#227;o da Justi&#231;a, cumpriu mandados de busca e apreens&#227;o em endere&#231;os de Taiguara em Santos. Era uma mina de ouro para a investiga&#231;&#227;o. A PF descobriu que Lula recebia tr&#234;s alcunhas nas conversas: tio, presidente e &#8220;chefe maior&#8221;.Uma das provas apreendidas pela PF era uma esp&#233;cie de di&#225;rio no computador do sobrinho de Lula, com diversos relatos da empresa e do petista. Eram textos em formato .doc, com Taiguara falando de si mesmo em terceira pessoa. Um dos primeiros &#8211; e mais relevantes &#8211; registros desse di&#225;rio &#233; de 2009, quando Taiguara descreve uma reuni&#227;o. Ele diz que esteve em Bras&#237;lia para conversar com o tio. Registrou at&#233; a dura&#231;&#227;o do encontro: 50 minutos. Taiguara resumiu a resposta de Lula dizendo que ele deu &#8220;carta branca&#8221; para os neg&#243;cios em Angola.Ap&#243;s esse encontro, com o aval de Lula, Taiguara preparou sua empresa para arrancar um naco dos contratos bilion&#225;rios da Odebrecht em Angola, financiados com dinheiro do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social). Como &#201;POCA revelou no ano passado, Lula fazia lobby para a empreiteira sob o pretexto de palestras, usando o status de ex-presidente para viabilizar obras fora do pa&#237;s bancadas pelo banco estatal.Pagamento da Odebrecht para a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)Contrato da Odebrecht com a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)O tio resolveAl&#233;m do di&#225;rio, a PF conseguiu recuperar mensagens de WhatsApp enviadas por Taiguara. Um dos destinat&#225;rios favoritos era um seguran&#231;a do ex-presidente Lula, de nome Valmir Morais. Funcion&#225;rio da Presid&#234;ncia da Rep&#250;blica, ele acompanhava Lula ap&#243;s o mandato. Como &#201;POCA revelou no in&#237;cio deste ano, Valmir era um dos seguran&#231;as que foram 111 vezes a Atibaia, no s&#237;tio que Lula diz n&#227;o ser dele. A PF descobriu que o seguran&#231;a era, tamb&#233;m, um homem de recados do ex-presidente, que n&#227;o usava celular. Numa das mensagens, Taiguara disse que havia chegado de Angola e precisava, com urg&#234;ncia, de uma reuni&#227;o com o tio.Outro lote de mensagens era com um parceiro de Taiguara em sua empresa, a Exergia. O conte&#250;do das conversas era expl&#237;cito. Numa delas, Taiguara fala que um projeto com a Odebrecht era uma fic&#231;&#227;o &#8211; o contrato depois foi firmado. Em outra, j&#225; em 2015, eles reclamavam das dificuldades em fechar neg&#243;cios. Na ocasi&#227;o, a Lava Jato j&#225; tinha atingido a empreiteira. Taiguara, de novo, ia direto ao ponto: ia falar com o tio para resolver os impasses com a Odebrecht.&#160;No total, foram 16 contratos da Odebrecht com a empresa de Taiguara, uma parceria pr&#243;spera, longa e diversificada. A conclus&#227;o da PF &#233; contundente: a empresa foi criada apenas para receber dinheiro da empreiteira, sem prestar servi&#231;os. N&#227;o havia outros clientes ou ind&#237;cios de qualquer servi&#231;o executado. Sobram, contudo, documentos que mostram uma gastan&#231;a de Taiguara, incluindo outros familiares de Lula, que tinham at&#233; o plano de sa&#250;de pago com o dinheiro da Exergia. Havia, claro, itens de luxo, como roupas e carros.Conforme os documentos eram analisados, a investiga&#231;&#227;o avan&#231;ava. Uma per&#237;cia concluiu pela &#8220;incapacidade t&#233;cnica e operacional&#8221; da Exergia. Soma-se a um documento interno da Odebrecht, que qualificava o servi&#231;o contratado de &#8220;imprest&#225;vel&#8221;. A conclus&#227;o da PF foi uma s&#243;: era imposs&#237;vel a nanica empresa de Santos executar as obras milion&#225;rias em Angola.As mensagens de Taiguara citando Lula n&#227;o eram mera bravata de um familiar se aproveitando do status de um parente famoso. A investiga&#231;&#227;o descobriu ainda diversas reuni&#245;es de Taiguara no Instituto Lula. Houve, tamb&#233;m, um encontro num hotel cinco estrelas em Angola. O primeiro ind&#237;cio surgiu de uma mensagem do pr&#243;prio Taiguara a um seguran&#231;a de Lula. Ele pedia um encontro, informava que estava no mesmo hotel do tio e citava o quarto. Lula esteve l&#225; duas vezes, sob o pretexto de dar palestras. As duas foram pagas pela Odebrecht.O empres&#225;rio Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, filho do irm&#227;o da primeira mulher de Lula, em depoimento &#224; CPI do BNDES em outubro de 2015 (Foto: Lucio Bernardo Junior / C&#226;mara dos Deputados)Procurada, a defesa de Lula enviou a seguinte nota por meio do Instituto Lula:O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva tem sua vida investigada h&#225; 40 anos, teve todas as suas contas e de seus familiares devassadas, seu sigilo banc&#225;rio, fiscal e telef&#244;nico quebrado&#160; e n&#227;o foi encontrada nenhuma irregularidade. Lula n&#227;o ocupa mais nenhum cargo p&#250;blico desde 1&#186; de janeiro de 2011, e sempre agiu dentro da lei antes, durante e depois de ocupar dois mandatos eleitos como presidente da Rep&#250;blica. A defesa do ex-presidente ir&#225; analisar o documento da Pol&#237;cia Federal, vazado para a imprensa e divulgado com sensacionalismo antes do acesso da defesa, porque essa pr&#225;tica deixa claro que n&#227;o s&#227;o processos s&#233;rios de investiga&#231;&#227;o, e sim uma campanha de massacre midi&#225;tico para produzir manchetes na imprensa e tentar destruir a imagem do ex-presidente mais popular da hist&#243;ria do pa&#237;s.&#160;&#201;POCA ainda n&#227;o localizou os advogados de Taiguara, mas t&#227;o logo obtenha um posicionamento atualizar&#225; esta reportagem para contemplar adequadamente a vers&#227;o dos citados. Na CPI do BNDES, ele disse que n&#227;o houve influ&#234;ncia de Lula no neg&#243;cio.No papel, Taiguara nem sequer &#233; sobrinho de Lula. Ele &#233; filho de Jacinto Ribeiro dos Santos, o Lambari, amigo de Lula e irm&#227;o da primeira mulher do ex-presidente, j&#225; morta. Mas o parentesco a&#237; se deu por afinidade. E a Odebrecht cimentou essa rela&#231;&#227;o.

O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva (Foto: Aloisio Mauricio / Fotoarena)A Pol&#237;cia Federal indiciou o ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva pelo crime de corrup&#231;&#227;o em raz&#227;o de evid&#234;ncias de propina de R$ 20 milh&#245;es mascarada em contratos da empreiteira Odebrecht,&#160;em Angola, firmados com a empresa Exergia, cujo s&#243;cio era Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, seu sobrinho.Lula foi indiciado por corrup&#231;&#227;o passiva, porque a PF concluiu que os contratos de Taiguara s&#243; aconteceram em raz&#227;o do parentesco e das rela&#231;&#245;es da empreiteira com Lula, al&#233;m dos documentos que citam o pr&#243;prio ex-presidente no neg&#243;cio. Seu sobrinho e sete executivos da empreiteira, incluindo Marcelo Odebrecht, foram indiciados por corrup&#231;&#227;o e lavagem.Leia tamb&#233;m:&gt;&gt;&#160;As opera&#231;&#245;es suspeitas da Odebrecht em Angola&gt;&gt; Palocci, o Italiano, a Odebrecht e o PTO indiciamento ocorreu ap&#243;s cinco meses de investiga&#231;&#227;o da Opera&#231;&#227;o Janus, que devassou contratos da empreiteira com a empresa Exergia. Em maio, a PF, com autoriza&#231;&#227;o da Justi&#231;a, cumpriu mandados de busca e apreens&#227;o em endere&#231;os de Taiguara em Santos. Era uma mina de ouro para a investiga&#231;&#227;o. A PF descobriu que Lula recebia tr&#234;s alcunhas nas conversas: tio, presidente e &#8220;chefe maior&#8221;.Uma das provas apreendidas pela PF era uma esp&#233;cie de di&#225;rio no computador do sobrinho de Lula, com diversos relatos da empresa e do petista. Eram textos em formato .doc, com Taiguara falando de si mesmo em terceira pessoa. Um dos primeiros &#8211; e mais relevantes &#8211; registros desse di&#225;rio &#233; de 2009, quando Taiguara descreve uma reuni&#227;o. Ele diz que esteve em Bras&#237;lia para conversar com o tio. Registrou at&#233; a dura&#231;&#227;o do encontro: 50 minutos. Taiguara resumiu a resposta de Lula dizendo que ele deu &#8220;carta branca&#8221; para os neg&#243;cios em Angola.Ap&#243;s esse encontro, com o aval de Lula, Taiguara preparou sua empresa para arrancar um naco dos contratos bilion&#225;rios da Odebrecht em Angola, financiados com dinheiro do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social). Como &#201;POCA revelou no ano passado, Lula fazia lobby para a empreiteira sob o pretexto de palestras, usando o status de ex-presidente para viabilizar obras fora do pa&#237;s bancadas pelo banco estatal.Pagamento da Odebrecht para a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)Contrato da Odebrecht com a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)O tio resolveAl&#233;m do di&#225;rio, a PF conseguiu recuperar mensagens de WhatsApp enviadas por Taiguara. Um dos destinat&#225;rios favoritos era um seguran&#231;a do ex-presidente Lula, de nome Valmir Morais. Funcion&#225;rio da Presid&#234;ncia da Rep&#250;blica, ele acompanhava Lula ap&#243;s o mandato. Como &#201;POCA revelou no in&#237;cio deste ano, Valmir era um dos seguran&#231;as que foram 111 vezes a Atibaia, no s&#237;tio que Lula diz n&#227;o ser dele. A PF descobriu que o seguran&#231;a era, tamb&#233;m, um homem de recados do ex-presidente, que n&#227;o usava celular. Numa das mensagens, Taiguara disse que havia chegado de Angola e precisava, com urg&#234;ncia, de uma reuni&#227;o com o tio.Outro lote de mensagens era com um parceiro de Taiguara em sua empresa, a Exergia. O conte&#250;do das conversas era expl&#237;cito. Numa delas, Taiguara fala que um projeto com a Odebrecht era uma fic&#231;&#227;o &#8211; o contrato depois foi firmado. Em outra, j&#225; em 2015, eles reclamavam das dificuldades em fechar neg&#243;cios. Na ocasi&#227;o, a Lava Jato j&#225; tinha atingido a empreiteira. Taiguara, de novo, ia direto ao ponto: ia falar com o tio para resolver os impasses com a Odebrecht.&#160;No total, foram 16 contratos da Odebrecht com a empresa de Taiguara, uma parceria pr&#243;spera, longa e diversificada. A conclus&#227;o da PF &#233; contundente: a empresa foi criada apenas para receber dinheiro da empreiteira, sem prestar servi&#231;os. N&#227;o havia outros clientes ou ind&#237;cios de qualquer servi&#231;o executado. Sobram, contudo, documentos que mostram uma gastan&#231;a de Taiguara, incluindo outros familiares de Lula, que tinham at&#233; o plano de sa&#250;de pago com o dinheiro da Exergia. Havia, claro, itens de luxo, como roupas e carros.Conforme os documentos eram analisados, a investiga&#231;&#227;o avan&#231;ava. Uma per&#237;cia concluiu pela &#8220;incapacidade t&#233;cnica e operacional&#8221; da Exergia. Soma-se a um documento interno da Odebrecht, que qualificava o servi&#231;o contratado de &#8220;imprest&#225;vel&#8221;. A conclus&#227;o da PF foi uma s&#243;: era imposs&#237;vel a nanica empresa de Santos executar as obras milion&#225;rias em Angola.As mensagens de Taiguara citando Lula n&#227;o eram mera bravata de um familiar se aproveitando do status de um parente famoso. A investiga&#231;&#227;o descobriu ainda diversas reuni&#245;es de Taiguara no Instituto Lula. Houve, tamb&#233;m, um encontro num hotel cinco estrelas em Angola. O primeiro ind&#237;cio surgiu de uma mensagem do pr&#243;prio Taiguara a um seguran&#231;a de Lula. Ele pedia um encontro, informava que estava no mesmo hotel do tio e citava o quarto. Lula esteve l&#225; duas vezes, sob o pretexto de dar palestras. As duas foram pagas pela Odebrecht.O empres&#225;rio Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, filho do irm&#227;o da primeira mulher de Lula, em depoimento &#224; CPI do BNDES em outubro de 2015 (Foto: Lucio Bernardo Junior / C&#226;mara dos Deputados)Procurada, a defesa de Lula enviou a seguinte nota por meio do Instituto Lula:O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva tem sua vida investigada h&#225; 40 anos, teve todas as suas contas e de seus familiares devassadas, seu sigilo banc&#225;rio, fiscal e telef&#244;nico quebrado&#160; e n&#227;o foi encontrada nenhuma irregularidade. Lula n&#227;o ocupa mais nenhum cargo p&#250;blico desde 1&#186; de janeiro de 2011, e sempre agiu dentro da lei antes, durante e depois de ocupar dois mandatos eleitos como presidente da Rep&#250;blica. A defesa do ex-presidente ir&#225; analisar o documento da Pol&#237;cia Federal, vazado para a imprensa e divulgado com sensacionalismo antes do acesso da defesa, porque essa pr&#225;tica deixa claro que n&#227;o s&#227;o processos s&#233;rios de investiga&#231;&#227;o, e sim uma campanha de massacre midi&#225;tico para produzir manchetes na imprensa e tentar destruir a imagem do ex-presidente mais popular da hist&#243;ria do pa&#237;s.&#160;&#201;POCA ainda n&#227;o localizou os advogados de Taiguara, mas t&#227;o logo obtenha um posicionamento atualizar&#225; esta reportagem para contemplar adequadamente a vers&#227;o dos citados. Na CPI do BNDES, ele disse que n&#227;o houve influ&#234;ncia de Lula no neg&#243;cio.No papel, Taiguara nem sequer &#233; sobrinho de Lula. Ele &#233; filho de Jacinto Ribeiro dos Santos, o Lambari, amigo de Lula e irm&#227;o da primeira mulher do ex-presidente, j&#225; morta. Mas o parentesco a&#237; se deu por afinidade. E a Odebrecht cimentou essa rela&#231;&#227;o.

The band was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. Metallica's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. The band expanded its musical direction and achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which resulted in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. The album was also their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, a success that they also achieved on their following four studio albums. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent from the band. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. The release of St. Anger (2003) alienated fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum, and a film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. The band returned to its original musical style with the release of Death Magnetic (2008), and in 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide.[1] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] As of December 2012, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S.[3][4] Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced four of the band's studio albums between 1990 and 2003 and served as a temporary bassist during the production of St. Anger. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. The band is currently promoting its tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which is expected to be released on November 18, 2016.[5]Contents1 History1.1 Formation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)1.2 Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)1.3 Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)1.4 ...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)1.5 Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)1.6 Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)1.7 Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)1.8 Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2012‚Äìpresent)2 Style and lyrical themes3 Legacy and influence4 Band members4.1 Timeline5 Awards6 Discography7 See also8 Notes9 References10 Sources11 External linksHistoryFormation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases and their last two albums, as well as Guitar Hero: MetallicaMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[6] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[6] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[7]Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[6] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[8] Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[9] The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.The term "thrash metal" was coined by Kerrang!'s journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang!'s issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[10] Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[11] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[11]Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[12]Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[12]Dave Mustaine went on to found rival band Megadeth after being released from the band in 1983.Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[15] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.&#160;1 guitarist in your magazine".[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[11]Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[19][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[20] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[21] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[22]Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200.[23] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[22]Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band as a client of Q-Prime Management.[24] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released Creeping Death as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record‚Äîcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"‚Äîappeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[25] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[24]Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[26] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[27] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[28] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[24] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[29]On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D√∂rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[29]Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[30] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[30]After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space‚Äîa suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"‚Äîand relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[31][32]Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[33]...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored‚Äîthough he received writing credit for the track "Blackened".[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]Metallica performing during its Damaged Justice tour in 1988In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, was hired as the producer. Metallica‚Äîalso known as The Black Album‚Äîwas remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages.[42] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[43] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[44] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[42] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[45] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[45]On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7&#160;m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger".[46] Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour; Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[46]Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)After almost three years of touring to promote the album Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[23] The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[47] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.[35][48]James Hetfield performing with the band during its Load tour in 1996During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[47] Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[23] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.[49] To promote Reload, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[50]In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.[50][51]On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[23]Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)Main article: Metallica v. Napster, Inc.In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[52] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[53]Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[52] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[54] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94&#160;million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[55] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[56]At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[35]Robert Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 during the recording of St. Anger.In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[60] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[60] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4&#160;pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[49] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[49]For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[49] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse‚Äîamong others‚Äîauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[49] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[61]Metallica performing during its Madly in Anger with the World Tour in 2004In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess".[64] However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking".[65] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69]Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989‚Äì2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[71] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[75] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[76]Death Magnetic debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200.[77] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[78]Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose album‚Äîthe other being Jack Johnson's album Sleep Through the Static‚Äîremained on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic also remained at number one on Billboard's Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia.[79][80] In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.[81][82]On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009,[83] and that former bassist Jason Newsted‚Äîwho left the band in 2001‚Äîwould perform with the band at the ceremony.[84] Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play because he "wanted to see the Black Album band".[85] However, during the band's set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage.[86] Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.[87]Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Warsaw Babice Airport, Warsaw, as a part of the Sonisphere Festival series. The show in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 22, 2010, was broadcast via satellite to cinemas.[88] The bands also played concerts in Bucharest on June 26, 2010, and Istanbul on June 27, 2010.

He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[94] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[95] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[96]In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record‚Äîit's my hero‚Äîit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[97] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[98] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[99][100]On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

The recording of the album was problematic at times; Lars Ulrich later said Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight".[110] On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material. He said, "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."[111]Metallica performing in Bangalore, India in 2011Metallica was due to make its first appearance in India at the "India Rocks" concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.[112] However, the concert was canceled when the venue was proven to be unsafe.[113] Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud.[114] Metallica made its Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011.[115][116] On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would headline the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, at the Download Festival at Donington Park and that the band would play the The Black Album in its entirety.[117] Metallica celebrated its 30th anniversary by playing four shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco in December 2011.

He also said, "I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013."[131] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimr√≥d and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27.[132] In an interview dated July 22, 2013, Ulrich told Ultimate Guitar, "2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record"; he said the album will most likely be released during 2015.[133] Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio.[134] At the second Orion Music + More festival held in Detroit, the band played under the name "Dehaan"‚Äîa reference to actor Dane DeHaan, who starred in Metallica: Through the Never.[135] The band performed its debut album Kill 'Em All in its entirety, celebrating the 30th anniversary of its release.[136] On December 8, 2013, the band played a show called "Freeze 'Em All" in Antarctica, becoming the first band to play on all seven continents.[137] The performance was filmed and released as a live album the same month.[138]Metallica performing during the Sonisphere Festival in 2014At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014, Metallica performed "One" with Chinese pianist Lang Lang.[139] In March 2014, Metallica began a tour called "Metallica By Request", in which fans request songs for the band to perform.[140] A new song, titled "Lords of Summer" was written for the concerts and released as a "first take" demo in June 2014.[141] In June 2014, the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival in an attempt to attract new fans.

"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".[153]On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016 via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.

(Master of Puppets), demonstrating Metallica's fast tempo, and aggressive musicianship featured in early releases"Sad but True" (1991)"Sad but True" (Metallica) Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone believed the band abandoned fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range in 1991"Purify" (2003)"Purify" (St. Anger), demonstrating Metallica's new musical approach with no guitar solos, a "raw, unpolished" sound, and Ulrich's snare drumProblems playing these files? See media help.Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions.[155] New wave of British heavy metal bands Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[156] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[157] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[157] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs‚Äîamong other themes‚Äîwere explored on Master of Puppets.[158]In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[159] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[160] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load‚Äîan album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach‚Äîthe band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[161] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza.[48] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[48] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[161]St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[65] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[162][163] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[164] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[165]Legacy and influenceMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[166] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide,[167] including an RIAA-certified 66&#160;million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the U.S., making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[168][169] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[170] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[171]Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[172] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old‚ÄîI'd never heard anything that heavy".[173] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets‚Äîand the staying power‚Äîa timeless record like that".[174] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[175][176] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica".[177] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[178] Ill Ni√±o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[179] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[180]Kerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium‚Äîall of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on The Simpsons' eighteenth season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".[181] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series Metalocalypse.[182] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[183]MTV ranked Metallica the third "Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History",[172] was listed fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock,[184] and the band was number one on VH1's 20 Greatest Metal Bands list.[185] Rolling Stone placed the band 61st on its list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time";[186] its albums Master of Puppets and Metallica were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[187] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time",[188] and was ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums",[189] and number one on Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list.[190] "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".[191]On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day "Official Metallica Day".[192] The band was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert paying tribute to the band with artists performing its songs was held. Performances included Sum 41 and a medley of "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Enter Sandman", and "Master of Puppets". Staind covered "Nothing Else Matters", Avril Lavigne played "Fuel", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed "Sad but True", Korn played "One", and Limp Bizkit performed "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)".[193]The Guitar Hero video game series included several of Metallica's songs. "One" was used in Guitar Hero III. The album Death Magnetic was later released as purchasable, downloadable content for the game. "Trapped Under Ice" was featured in the sequel, Guitar Hero World Tour. In 2009, Metallica collaborated with the game's developers to make Guitar Hero: Metallica, which included a number of Metallica's songs. Harmonix' video game series Rock Band included "Enter Sandman"; "Ride the Lightning", "Blackened", and "...And Justice for All" were released as downloadable tracks.

He was nominated for six awards overall.In the hours leading up to the show, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network‚Äôs support of Eminem. The group claims his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals and women. And yet he brought the crowd to its feet with his second song, apparently addressing his critics with the angry rap, ‚ÄúI am whatever you say I am.‚Ä?True to form, it was a wild evening with plenty of scantily clad musicians and flying obscenities. The oddest moment came when Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim C. climbed the set as Limp Bizkit accepted the award for Best Rock Video for ‚ÄúBreak Things.‚Ä?Bizkit lead singer Fred Durst got a kick out of the gesture, saying, ‚ÄúStage dive dude.‚Ä? Meanwhile, guitarist Wes Borland praised the stunt. ‚ÄúThis guy is rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúHe should be getting the award.‚Ä?What he did get was arrested after being hustled out of Radio City Music Hall and handcuffed. One ofRage Against the Machine‚Äôs bodyguards was also arrested for obstructing justice.One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn Fanning appeared on stage in a Metallica T-shirt. The heavy metal band is leading the fight to stop Fanning‚Äôs Internet song-sharing service. Fanning joked that he had some help with his wardrobe, ‚Äúactually a friend of mine shared it with me.‚Ä?Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich struck back in a pre-taped video in which he raided a dorm room saying ‚Äúsharing‚Äôs only fun when it‚Äôs not your stuff.‚Ä? Proving the fans are not on his side about the issue, Ulrich met a barrage of boos and cat calls at the end of the show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink 182.Bad Day For the KidsSome of the youngest stars who get a lot of attention from fans walked away empty handed. Both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were snubbed. Still, Britney will surely be remembered for her nearly sheer bikini top and pants ‚Äî easily the raciest number of the evening.If there were an award for the wildest hair, singer Pink would surely take the prize with her spikey, bubble gum-colored styling. Close behind, would have to be singer Macy Gray, sporting a poofed out red afro to accept her award for Best New Artist for her soulful ballad ‚ÄúI Try.‚Ä?It was almost ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Ä? for ‚ÄôN Sync who got off to a slow start, eventually picking up half of the six awards they were nominated for; Best Choreography, Best Dance Video and not surprising, Viewer‚Äôs Choice Award.Singer Justin Timberlake was visibly relieved with the band‚Äôs first win. ‚ÄúI thought we was gonna walk outta here like Susan Lucci, so I‚Äôm glad we won at least one,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúWe got a moon man, we got a moon man!‚Ä?Aaliyah was also a double winner, with Best Female Video and Best Video From a Film for ‚ÄúTry Again.‚Ä?But it was Eminem who claimed the most coveted moon man, for Video of the Year. The award was handed out by a commanding Whitney Houston who received a standing ovation while singing her way to the stage, proving she still has her pipes.When accepting, Eminem struck back at the army of defamation lawsuits and bashing he‚Äôs endured over the past year.‚ÄúEvery time that like a relative sues me, or every time a critic tries to slam me in the press or whatever, I sell more records. So I really want to thank you people for making my record as big as it is,‚Ä? he said.‚Ä?I‚Äôm going to take this [award] home and put it right between myBritney Spears and Christina Aguilera posters.‚Ä?Spoofs, Surprises and PeppersShawn Wayans kicked off the event posing as comedian Chris Rock, last year‚Äôs host. He proceeded to insult most of the star-studded audience, and ended up getting pounced on in a mock riot with Britney Spears and boy band lookalikes pummeling him.Steven Tyler and Dr. Dre handed out the first awards for Best Group Video, to Blink 182 for ‚ÄúAll the Small Things,‚Ä? then a surprised Jennifer Lopez picked up the award for Best Dance Video ‚ÄúWaiting For Tonight.‚Ä?She was practically speechless about the distinction, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy, if I forgot you I‚Äôm sorry.‚Ä?Veteran rock act the Red Hot Chili Peppers added two more awards to their accolades, including Best Direction in a Video for ‚ÄúCalifornication,‚Ä? and the Video Vanguard Award (MTV‚Äôs version of a lifetime achievement award).For a night that celebrated one of the angriest singers in the business, bassist Flea capped off the Chili Peppers acceptance speech with a far less threatening statement. He said he was grateful for everything including the gray hairs in his mohawk and went on to offer a special wish to his daughter, saying ‚ÄúI hope you had a great first day at school.‚Ä?ABCNEWS Radio and The Associated Press contributed to this report.0 SharesEmail Star Comments   Eminem and 'N Sync Big VMA Winners        "   Filmmaker Hopes You Will Leave '13th' With a Curiosity to Know More        "   Minnie Driver Says 'Speechless' Typifies Cerebral Palsy       "   Dance On 'til Dawn Prince Tribute Begins Tonight        "   Janet Jackson Confirms She's Pregnant at 50       "   Chris Pratt Reflects on Son's Premature Birth       "   Miley Cyrus Opens Up About Identifying as Pansexual       "   Actress 'OK' With Sex Assault Victims' Skipping 'Birth of a Nation'       "   Princess Kate Takes First Solo Trip Abroad as a Royal       "   Rod Stewart Knighted by Prince William       "   GOP Senator Who Urged Trump to Step Aside Supports Him Again       "   Lawmaker Apologizes for Saying He'd 'Consider' Dumping Trump if He Said He Liked Raping Women       "   Trump Campaign Manager Berates 'Wishy-Washy' Republican Leaders          Judge Extends Florida's Voter Registration to Oct. 18       "   Trump's Lewd Remarks Concern Campuses Fighting Sex Assault         Texas Police Chief Vows to Punish Officers in Trump Caps         Hurricane Nicole Is Headed to Bermuda as Cat.2 Storm       "   Actress Faces Oct. 24 Court Date in Dakota Access Protest       "   Donald Trump Slams Clinton for WikiLeaks Emails       "   Obama on Lewd Trump Tape: 'That's Not Right'       "   Al Gore: Trump Would Create a 'Climate Catastrophe' in US        "   Eric Trump: 'Alpha Personalities' Sometimes Engage in 'Locker Room Talk'       "   'Unprecedented' Rift Among Republicans Puts Party's Survival in Limbo, Experts Say       "   Trump‚Äôs Debate Talk Defies Evidence Tying Russia to Hacks       "   Chris Christie Slams Trump's Remarks About Women as 'Indefensible'       "   Trump Goes on Tirade Against Paul Ryan, 'Disloyal' Republicans       "   A Legal Perspective on Public Access to Possible Tape of Trump From 'The Apprentice'        "   Why Do Evangelicals Prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton?

The band was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. Metallica's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. The band expanded its musical direction and achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which resulted in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. The album was also their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, a success that they also achieved on their following four studio albums. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent from the band. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. The release of St. Anger (2003) alienated fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum, and a film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. The band returned to its original musical style with the release of Death Magnetic (2008), and in 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide.[1] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] As of December 2012, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S.[3][4] Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced four of the band's studio albums between 1990 and 2003 and served as a temporary bassist during the production of St. Anger. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. The band is currently promoting its tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which is expected to be released on November 18, 2016.[5]Contents1 History1.1 Formation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)1.2 Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)1.3 Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)1.4 ...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)1.5 Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)1.6 Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)1.7 Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)1.8 Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2012‚Äìpresent)2 Style and lyrical themes3 Legacy and influence4 Band members4.1 Timeline5 Awards6 Discography7 See also8 Notes9 References10 Sources11 External linksHistoryFormation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases and their last two albums, as well as Guitar Hero: MetallicaMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[6] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[6] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[7]Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[6] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[8] Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[9] The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.The term "thrash metal" was coined by Kerrang!'s journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang!'s issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[10] Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[11] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[11]Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[12]Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[12]Dave Mustaine went on to found rival band Megadeth after being released from the band in 1983.Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[15] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.&#160;1 guitarist in your magazine".[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[11]Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[19][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[20] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[21] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[22]Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200.[23] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[22]Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band as a client of Q-Prime Management.[24] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released Creeping Death as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record‚Äîcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"‚Äîappeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[25] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[24]Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[26] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[27] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[28] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[24] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[29]On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D√∂rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[29]Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[30] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[30]After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space‚Äîa suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"‚Äîand relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[31][32]Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[33]...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored‚Äîthough he received writing credit for the track "Blackened".[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]Metallica performing during its Damaged Justice tour in 1988In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, was hired as the producer. Metallica‚Äîalso known as The Black Album‚Äîwas remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages.[42] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[43] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[44] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[42] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[45] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[45]On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7&#160;m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger".[46] Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour; Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[46]Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)After almost three years of touring to promote the album Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[23] The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[47] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.[35][48]James Hetfield performing with the band during its Load tour in 1996During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[47] Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[23] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.[49] To promote Reload, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[50]In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.[50][51]On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[23]Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)Main article: Metallica v. Napster, Inc.In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[52] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[53]Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[52] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[54] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94&#160;million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[55] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[56]At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[35]Robert Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 during the recording of St. Anger.In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[60] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[60] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4&#160;pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[49] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[49]For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[49] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse‚Äîamong others‚Äîauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[49] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[61]Metallica performing during its Madly in Anger with the World Tour in 2004In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess".[64] However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking".[65] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69]Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989‚Äì2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[71] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[75] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[76]Death Magnetic debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200.[77] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[78]Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks.

He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[94] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[95] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[96]In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record‚Äîit's my hero‚Äîit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[97] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[98] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[99][100]On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

He said, "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."[111]Metallica performing in Bangalore, India in 2011Metallica was due to make its first appearance in India at the "India Rocks" concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.[112] However, the concert was canceled when the venue was proven to be unsafe.[113] Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud.[114] Metallica made its Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011.[115][116] On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would headline the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, at the Download Festival at Donington Park and that the band would play the The Black Album in its entirety.[117] Metallica celebrated its 30th anniversary by playing four shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco in December 2011.

"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".[153]On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016 via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.

(Master of Puppets), demonstrating Metallica's fast tempo, and aggressive musicianship featured in early releases"Sad but True" (1991)"Sad but True" (Metallica) Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone believed the band abandoned fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range in 1991"Purify" (2003)"Purify" (St. Anger), demonstrating Metallica's new musical approach with no guitar solos, a "raw, unpolished" sound, and Ulrich's snare drumProblems playing these files? See media help.Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions.[155] New wave of British heavy metal bands Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[156] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[157] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[157] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs‚Äîamong other themes‚Äîwere explored on Master of Puppets.[158]In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[159] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[160] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load‚Äîan album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach‚Äîthe band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[161] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza.[48] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[48] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[161]St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[65] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[162][163] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[164] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[165]Legacy and influenceMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[166] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide,[167] including an RIAA-certified 66&#160;million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the U.S., making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[168][169] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[170] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[171]Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[172] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old‚ÄîI'd never heard anything that heavy".[173] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets‚Äîand the staying power‚Äîa timeless record like that".[174] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[175][176] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica".[177] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[178] Ill Ni√±o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[179] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[180]Kerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium‚Äîall of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on The Simpsons' eighteenth season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".[181] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series Metalocalypse.[182] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[183]MTV ranked Metallica the third "Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History",[172] was listed fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock,[184] and the band was number one on VH1's 20 Greatest Metal Bands list.[185] Rolling Stone placed the band 61st on its list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time";[186] its albums Master of Puppets and Metallica were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[187] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time",[188] and was ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums",[189] and number one on Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list.[190] "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".[191]On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day "Official Metallica Day".[192] The band was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert paying tribute to the band with artists performing its songs was held.

Staind covered "Nothing Else Matters", Avril Lavigne played "Fuel", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed "Sad but True", Korn played "One", and Limp Bizkit performed "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)".[193]The Guitar Hero video game series included several of Metallica's songs.

He was nominated for six awards overall.In the hours leading up to the show, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network‚Äôs support of Eminem. The group claims his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals and women. And yet he brought the crowd to its feet with his second song, apparently addressing his critics with the angry rap, ‚ÄúI am whatever you say I am.‚Ä?True to form, it was a wild evening with plenty of scantily clad musicians and flying obscenities. The oddest moment came when Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim C. climbed the set as Limp Bizkit accepted the award for Best Rock Video for ‚ÄúBreak Things.‚Ä?Bizkit lead singer Fred Durst got a kick out of the gesture, saying, ‚ÄúStage dive dude.‚Ä? Meanwhile, guitarist Wes Borland praised the stunt. ‚ÄúThis guy is rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúHe should be getting the award.‚Ä?What he did get was arrested after being hustled out of Radio City Music Hall and handcuffed. One ofRage Against the Machine‚Äôs bodyguards was also arrested for obstructing justice.One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn Fanning appeared on stage in a Metallica T-shirt. The heavy metal band is leading the fight to stop Fanning‚Äôs Internet song-sharing service. Fanning joked that he had some help with his wardrobe, ‚Äúactually a friend of mine shared it with me.‚Ä?Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich struck back in a pre-taped video in which he raided a dorm room saying ‚Äúsharing‚Äôs only fun when it‚Äôs not your stuff.‚Ä? Proving the fans are not on his side about the issue, Ulrich met a barrage of boos and cat calls at the end of the show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink 182.Bad Day For the KidsSome of the youngest stars who get a lot of attention from fans walked away empty handed. Both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were snubbed. Still, Britney will surely be remembered for her nearly sheer bikini top and pants ‚Äî easily the raciest number of the evening.If there were an award for the wildest hair, singer Pink would surely take the prize with her spikey, bubble gum-colored styling. Close behind, would have to be singer Macy Gray, sporting a poofed out red afro to accept her award for Best New Artist for her soulful ballad ‚ÄúI Try.‚Ä?It was almost ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Ä? for ‚ÄôN Sync who got off to a slow start, eventually picking up half of the six awards they were nominated for; Best Choreography, Best Dance Video and not surprising, Viewer‚Äôs Choice Award.Singer Justin Timberlake was visibly relieved with the band‚Äôs first win. ‚ÄúI thought we was gonna walk outta here like Susan Lucci, so I‚Äôm glad we won at least one,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúWe got a moon man, we got a moon man!‚Ä?Aaliyah was also a double winner, with Best Female Video and Best Video From a Film for ‚ÄúTry Again.‚Ä?But it was Eminem who claimed the most coveted moon man, for Video of the Year. The award was handed out by a commanding Whitney Houston who received a standing ovation while singing her way to the stage, proving she still has her pipes.When accepting, Eminem struck back at the army of defamation lawsuits and bashing he‚Äôs endured over the past year.‚ÄúEvery time that like a relative sues me, or every time a critic tries to slam me in the press or whatever, I sell more records. So I really want to thank you people for making my record as big as it is,‚Ä? he said.‚Ä?I‚Äôm going to take this [award] home and put it right between myBritney Spears and Christina Aguilera posters.‚Ä?Spoofs, Surprises and PeppersShawn Wayans kicked off the event posing as comedian Chris Rock, last year‚Äôs host. He proceeded to insult most of the star-studded audience, and ended up getting pounced on in a mock riot with Britney Spears and boy band lookalikes pummeling him.Steven Tyler and Dr. Dre handed out the first awards for Best Group Video, to Blink 182 for ‚ÄúAll the Small Things,‚Ä? then a surprised Jennifer Lopez picked up the award for Best Dance Video ‚ÄúWaiting For Tonight.‚Ä?She was practically speechless about the distinction, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy, if I forgot you I‚Äôm sorry.‚Ä?Veteran rock act the Red Hot Chili Peppers added two more awards to their accolades, including Best Direction in a Video for ‚ÄúCalifornication,‚Ä? and the Video Vanguard Award (MTV‚Äôs version of a lifetime achievement award).For a night that celebrated one of the angriest singers in the business, bassist Flea capped off the Chili Peppers acceptance speech with a far less threatening statement. He said he was grateful for everything including the gray hairs in his mohawk and went on to offer a special wish to his daughter, saying ‚ÄúI hope you had a great first day at school.‚Ä?ABCNEWS Radio and The Associated Press contributed to this report.0 SharesEmail Star Comments   Eminem and 'N Sync Big VMA Winners        "   Filmmaker Hopes You Will Leave '13th' With a Curiosity to Know More        "   Minnie Driver Says 'Speechless' Typifies Cerebral Palsy       "   Dance On 'til Dawn Prince Tribute Begins Tonight        "   Janet Jackson Confirms She's Pregnant at 50       "   Chris Pratt Reflects on Son's Premature Birth       "   Miley Cyrus Opens Up About Identifying as Pansexual       "   Actress 'OK' With Sex Assault Victims' Skipping 'Birth of a Nation'       "   Princess Kate Takes First Solo Trip Abroad as a Royal       "   Rod Stewart Knighted by Prince William       "   GOP Senator Who Urged Trump to Step Aside Supports Him Again       "   Lawmaker Apologizes for Saying He'd 'Consider' Dumping Trump if He Said He Liked Raping Women       "   Trump Campaign Manager Berates 'Wishy-Washy' Republican Leaders          Judge Extends Voter Registration in Battleground Florida       "   Trump's Lewd Remarks Concern Campuses Fighting Sex Assault         Texas Police Chief Vows to Punish Officers in Trump Caps         Hurricane Nicole Is Headed to Bermuda as Cat.2 Storm       "   Actress Faces Oct. 24 Court Date in Dakota Access Protest       "   Donald Trump Slams Clinton for WikiLeaks Emails       "   Obama on Lewd Trump Tape: 'That's Not Right'       "   Al Gore: Trump Would Create a 'Climate Catastrophe' in US        "   Eric Trump: 'Alpha Personalities' Sometimes Engage in 'Locker Room Talk'       "   'Unprecedented' Rift Among Republicans Puts Party's Survival in Limbo, Experts Say       "   Trump‚Äôs Debate Talk Defies Evidence Tying Russia to Hacks       "   Chris Christie Slams Trump's Remarks About Women as 'Indefensible'       "   Trump Goes on Tirade Against Paul Ryan, 'Disloyal' Republicans       "   A Legal Perspective on Public Access to Possible Tape of Trump From 'The Apprentice'        "   Why Do Evangelicals Prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton?

The band was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. Metallica's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. The band expanded its musical direction and achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which resulted in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. The album was also their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, a success that they also achieved on their following four studio albums. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent from the band. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. The release of St. Anger (2003) alienated fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum, and a film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. The band returned to its original musical style with the release of Death Magnetic (2008), and in 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide.[1] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] As of December 2012, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S.[3][4] Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced four of the band's studio albums between 1990 and 2003 and served as a temporary bassist during the production of St. Anger. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. The band is currently promoting its tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which is expected to be released on November 18, 2016.[5]Contents1 History1.1 Formation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)1.2 Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)1.3 Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)1.4 ...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)1.5 Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)1.6 Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)1.7 Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)1.8 Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2012‚Äìpresent)2 Style and lyrical themes3 Legacy and influence4 Band members4.1 Timeline5 Awards6 Discography7 See also8 Notes9 References10 Sources11 External linksHistoryFormation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases and their last two albums, as well as Guitar Hero: MetallicaMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[6] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[6] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[7]Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[6] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[8] Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[9] The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.The term "thrash metal" was coined by Kerrang!'s journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang!'s issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[10] Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[11] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[11]Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[12]Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[12]Dave Mustaine went on to found rival band Megadeth after being released from the band in 1983.Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[15] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.&#160;1 guitarist in your magazine".[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[11]Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[19][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[20] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[21] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[22]Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200.[23] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[22]Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band as a client of Q-Prime Management.[24] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released Creeping Death as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record‚Äîcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"‚Äîappeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[25] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[24]Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[26] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[27] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[28] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[24] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[29]On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D√∂rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[29]Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[30] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[30]After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space‚Äîa suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"‚Äîand relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[31][32]Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[33]...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored‚Äîthough he received writing credit for the track "Blackened".[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]Metallica performing during its Damaged Justice tour in 1988In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, was hired as the producer. Metallica‚Äîalso known as The Black Album‚Äîwas remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages.[42] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[43] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[44] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[42] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[45] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[45]On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7&#160;m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger".[46] Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour; Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[46]Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)After almost three years of touring to promote the album Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[23] The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[47] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.[35][48]James Hetfield performing with the band during its Load tour in 1996During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[47] Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[23] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.[49] To promote Reload, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[50]In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.[50][51]On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[23]Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)Main article: Metallica v. Napster, Inc.In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[52] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[53]Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[52] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[54] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94&#160;million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[55] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[56]At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[35]Robert Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 during the recording of St. Anger.In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[60] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[60] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4&#160;pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[49] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[49]For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[49] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse‚Äîamong others‚Äîauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[49] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[61]Metallica performing during its Madly in Anger with the World Tour in 2004In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess".[64] However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking".[65] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69]Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989‚Äì2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[71] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[75] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[76]Death Magnetic debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200.[77] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[78]Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose album‚Äîthe other being Jack Johnson's album Sleep Through the Static‚Äîremained on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic also remained at number one on Billboard's Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia.[79][80] In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.[81][82]On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009,[83] and that former bassist Jason Newsted‚Äîwho left the band in 2001‚Äîwould perform with the band at the ceremony.[84] Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play because he "wanted to see the Black Album band".[85] However, during the band's set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage.[86] Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.[87]Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Warsaw Babice Airport, Warsaw, as a part of the Sonisphere Festival series. The show in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 22, 2010, was broadcast via satellite to cinemas.[88] The bands also played concerts in Bucharest on June 26, 2010, and Istanbul on June 27, 2010. On June 28, 2010, Death Magnetic was certified 2X platinum by the RIAA.[89]Metallica performing during its World Magnetic Tour in 2009Metallica's World Magnetic Tour ended in Melbourne on November 21, 2010. The band had been touring for over two years in support of Death Magnetic. To accompany the final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live, limited edition EP of past performances in Australia called Six Feet Down Under was released.[90] The EP was followed by Six Feet Down Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010.[91] Part 2 contains a further eight songs recorded during the first two Oceanic Legs of the World Magnetic Tour.On November 26, 2010, Metallica released a live EP titled Live at Grimey's, which was recorded in June 2008 at Grimey's Record Store, just before the band's appearance at Bonnaroo Music Festival that year.[92][93]In a June 2009 interview with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica was planning to continue touring until August 2010, and that there were no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[94] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[95] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[96]In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record‚Äîit's my hero‚Äîit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[97] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[98] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[99][100]On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

The album, which was titled Lulu, was recorded over several months and comprised ten songs[108] based on Frank Wedekind's "Lulu" plays Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box.[109] The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times; Lars Ulrich later said Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight".[110] On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material. He said, "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."[111]Metallica performing in Bangalore, India in 2011Metallica was due to make its first appearance in India at the "India Rocks" concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.[112] However, the concert was canceled when the venue was proven to be unsafe.[113] Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud.[114] Metallica made its Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011.[115][116] On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would headline the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, at the Download Festival at Donington Park and that the band would play the The Black Album in its entirety.[117] Metallica celebrated its 30th anniversary by playing four shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco in December 2011.

Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases.[125][126] The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label.

He also said, "I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013."[131] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimr√≥d and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27.[132] In an interview dated July 22, 2013, Ulrich told Ultimate Guitar, "2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record"; he said the album will most likely be released during 2015.[133] Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio.[134] At the second Orion Music + More festival held in Detroit, the band played under the name "Dehaan"‚Äîa reference to actor Dane DeHaan, who starred in Metallica: Through the Never.[135] The band performed its debut album Kill 'Em All in its entirety, celebrating the 30th anniversary of its release.[136] On December 8, 2013, the band played a show called "Freeze 'Em All" in Antarctica, becoming the first band to play on all seven continents.[137] The performance was filmed and released as a live album the same month.[138]Metallica performing during the Sonisphere Festival in 2014At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014, Metallica performed "One" with Chinese pianist Lang Lang.[139] In March 2014, Metallica began a tour called "Metallica By Request", in which fans request songs for the band to perform.[140] A new song, titled "Lords of Summer" was written for the concerts and released as a "first take" demo in June 2014.[141] In June 2014, the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival in an attempt to attract new fans.

"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".[153]On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016 via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.

See media help.Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions.[155] New wave of British heavy metal bands Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[156] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[157] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[157] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs‚Äîamong other themes‚Äîwere explored on Master of Puppets.[158]In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[159] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[160] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load‚Äîan album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach‚Äîthe band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[161] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza.[48] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[48] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[161]St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[65] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[162][163] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[164] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[165]Legacy and influenceMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[166] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide,[167] including an RIAA-certified 66&#160;million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the U.S., making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[168][169] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[170] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[171]Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[172] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old‚ÄîI'd never heard anything that heavy".[173] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets‚Äîand the staying power‚Äîa timeless record like that".[174] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[175][176] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica".[177] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[178] Ill Ni√±o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[179] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[180]Kerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium‚Äîall of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on The Simpsons' eighteenth season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".[181] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series Metalocalypse.[182] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[183]MTV ranked Metallica the third "Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History",[172] was listed fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock,[184] and the band was number one on VH1's 20 Greatest Metal Bands list.[185] Rolling Stone placed the band 61st on its list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time";[186] its albums Master of Puppets and Metallica were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[187] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time",[188] and was ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums",[189] and number one on Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list.[190] "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".[191]On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame.

He was nominated for six awards overall.In the hours leading up to the show, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network‚Äôs support of Eminem. The group claims his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals and women. And yet he brought the crowd to its feet with his second song, apparently addressing his critics with the angry rap, ‚ÄúI am whatever you say I am.‚Ä?True to form, it was a wild evening with plenty of scantily clad musicians and flying obscenities. The oddest moment came when Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim C. climbed the set as Limp Bizkit accepted the award for Best Rock Video for ‚ÄúBreak Things.‚Ä?Bizkit lead singer Fred Durst got a kick out of the gesture, saying, ‚ÄúStage dive dude.‚Ä? Meanwhile, guitarist Wes Borland praised the stunt. ‚ÄúThis guy is rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúHe should be getting the award.‚Ä?What he did get was arrested after being hustled out of Radio City Music Hall and handcuffed. One ofRage Against the Machine‚Äôs bodyguards was also arrested for obstructing justice.One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn Fanning appeared on stage in a Metallica T-shirt. The heavy metal band is leading the fight to stop Fanning‚Äôs Internet song-sharing service. Fanning joked that he had some help with his wardrobe, ‚Äúactually a friend of mine shared it with me.‚Ä?Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich struck back in a pre-taped video in which he raided a dorm room saying ‚Äúsharing‚Äôs only fun when it‚Äôs not your stuff.‚Ä? Proving the fans are not on his side about the issue, Ulrich met a barrage of boos and cat calls at the end of the show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink 182.Bad Day For the KidsSome of the youngest stars who get a lot of attention from fans walked away empty handed. Both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were snubbed. Still, Britney will surely be remembered for her nearly sheer bikini top and pants ‚Äî easily the raciest number of the evening.If there were an award for the wildest hair, singer Pink would surely take the prize with her spikey, bubble gum-colored styling. Close behind, would have to be singer Macy Gray, sporting a poofed out red afro to accept her award for Best New Artist for her soulful ballad ‚ÄúI Try.‚Ä?It was almost ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Ä? for ‚ÄôN Sync who got off to a slow start, eventually picking up half of the six awards they were nominated for; Best Choreography, Best Dance Video and not surprising, Viewer‚Äôs Choice Award.Singer Justin Timberlake was visibly relieved with the band‚Äôs first win. ‚ÄúI thought we was gonna walk outta here like Susan Lucci, so I‚Äôm glad we won at least one,‚Ä? he said. ‚ÄúWe got a moon man, we got a moon man!‚Ä?Aaliyah was also a double winner, with Best Female Video and Best Video From a Film for ‚ÄúTry Again.‚Ä?But it was Eminem who claimed the most coveted moon man, for Video of the Year. The award was handed out by a commanding Whitney Houston who received a standing ovation while singing her way to the stage, proving she still has her pipes.When accepting, Eminem struck back at the army of defamation lawsuits and bashing he‚Äôs endured over the past year.‚ÄúEvery time that like a relative sues me, or every time a critic tries to slam me in the press or whatever, I sell more records. So I really want to thank you people for making my record as big as it is,‚Ä? he said.‚Ä?I‚Äôm going to take this [award] home and put it right between myBritney Spears and Christina Aguilera posters.‚Ä?Spoofs, Surprises and PeppersShawn Wayans kicked off the event posing as comedian Chris Rock, last year‚Äôs host. He proceeded to insult most of the star-studded audience, and ended up getting pounced on in a mock riot with Britney Spears and boy band lookalikes pummeling him.Steven Tyler and Dr. Dre handed out the first awards for Best Group Video, to Blink 182 for ‚ÄúAll the Small Things,‚Ä? then a surprised Jennifer Lopez picked up the award for Best Dance Video ‚ÄúWaiting For Tonight.‚Ä?She was practically speechless about the distinction, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy, if I forgot you I‚Äôm sorry.‚Ä?Veteran rock act the Red Hot Chili Peppers added two more awards to their accolades, including Best Direction in a Video for ‚ÄúCalifornication,‚Ä? and the Video Vanguard Award (MTV‚Äôs version of a lifetime achievement award).For a night that celebrated one of the angriest singers in the business, bassist Flea capped off the Chili Peppers acceptance speech with a far less threatening statement. He said he was grateful for everything including the gray hairs in his mohawk and went on to offer a special wish to his daughter, saying ‚ÄúI hope you had a great first day at school.‚Ä?ABCNEWS Radio and The Associated Press contributed to this report.0 SharesEmail Star Comments   Eminem and 'N Sync Big VMA Winners        "   Filmmaker Hopes You Will Leave '13th' With a Curiosity to Know More        "   Minnie Driver Says 'Speechless' Typifies Cerebral Palsy       "   Dance On 'til Dawn Prince Tribute Begins Tonight        "   Janet Jackson Confirms She's Pregnant at 50       "   Chris Pratt Reflects on Son's Premature Birth       "   Miley Cyrus Opens Up About Identifying as Pansexual       "   Actress 'OK' With Sex Assault Victims' Skipping 'Birth of a Nation'       "   Princess Kate Takes First Solo Trip Abroad as a Royal       "   Rod Stewart Knighted by Prince William       "   GOP Senator Who Urged Trump to Step Aside Supports Him Again       "   Lawmaker Apologizes for Saying He'd 'Consider' Dumping Trump if He Said He Liked Raping Women       "   Trump Campaign Manager Berates 'Wishy-Washy' Republican Leaders          Judge Extends Voter Registration in Battleground Florida       "   Trump's Lewd Remarks Concern Campuses Fighting Sex Assault         Texas Police Chief Vows to Punish Officers in Trump Caps         Hurricane Nicole Is Headed to Bermuda as Cat.2 Storm       "   Actress Faces Oct. 24 Court Date in Dakota Access Protest       "   Donald Trump Slams Clinton for WikiLeaks Emails       "   Obama on Lewd Trump Tape: 'That's Not Right'       "   Al Gore: Trump Would Create a 'Climate Catastrophe' in US        "   Eric Trump: 'Alpha Personalities' Sometimes Engage in 'Locker Room Talk'       "   'Unprecedented' Rift Among Republicans Puts Party's Survival in Limbo, Experts Say       "   Trump‚Äôs Debate Talk Defies Evidence Tying Russia to Hacks       "   Chris Christie Slams Trump's Remarks About Women as 'Indefensible'       "   Trump Goes on Tirade Against Paul Ryan, 'Disloyal' Republicans       "   A Legal Perspective on Public Access to Possible Tape of Trump From 'The Apprentice'        "   Why Do Evangelicals Prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton?

The band was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. Metallica's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. The band expanded its musical direction and achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which resulted in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. The album was also their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, a success that they also achieved on their following four studio albums. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent from the band. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. The release of St. Anger (2003) alienated fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum, and a film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. The band returned to its original musical style with the release of Death Magnetic (2008), and in 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide.[1] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] As of December 2012, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S.[3][4] Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced four of the band's studio albums between 1990 and 2003 and served as a temporary bassist during the production of St. Anger. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. The band is currently promoting its tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which is expected to be released on November 18, 2016.[5]Contents1 History1.1 Formation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)1.2 Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)1.3 Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)1.4 ...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)1.5 Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)1.6 Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)1.7 Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)1.8 Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2012‚Äìpresent)2 Style and lyrical themes3 Legacy and influence4 Band members4.1 Timeline5 Awards6 Discography7 See also8 Notes9 References10 Sources11 External linksHistoryFormation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases and their last two albums, as well as Guitar Hero: MetallicaMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[6] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[6] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[7]Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[6] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[8] Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[9] The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.The term "thrash metal" was coined by Kerrang!'s journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang!'s issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[10] Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[11] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[11]Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[12]Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[12]Dave Mustaine went on to found rival band Megadeth after being released from the band in 1983.Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[15] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.&#160;1 guitarist in your magazine".[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[11]Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[19][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[20] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[21] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[22]Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200.[23] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[22]Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band as a client of Q-Prime Management.[24] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released Creeping Death as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record‚Äîcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"‚Äîappeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[25] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[24]Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[26] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[27] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[28] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[24] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[29]On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D√∂rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[29]Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[30] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[30]After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space‚Äîa suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"‚Äîand relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[31][32]Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[33]...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored‚Äîthough he received writing credit for the track "Blackened".[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]Metallica performing during its Damaged Justice tour in 1988In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, was hired as the producer. Metallica‚Äîalso known as The Black Album‚Äîwas remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages.[42] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[43] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[44] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[42] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[45] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[45]On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7&#160;m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger".[46] Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour; Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[46]Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)After almost three years of touring to promote the album Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[23] The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[47] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.[35][48]James Hetfield performing with the band during its Load tour in 1996During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[47] Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[23] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.[49] To promote Reload, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[50]In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.[50][51]On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[23]Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)Main article: Metallica v. Napster, Inc.In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[52] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[53]Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[52] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[54] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94&#160;million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[55] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[56]At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[35]Robert Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 during the recording of St. Anger.In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[60] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[60] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4&#160;pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[49] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[49]For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[49] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse‚Äîamong others‚Äîauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[49] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[61]Metallica performing during its Madly in Anger with the World Tour in 2004In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess".[64] However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking".[65] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69]Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989‚Äì2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[71] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[75] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[76]Death Magnetic debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200.[77] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[78]Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose album‚Äîthe other being Jack Johnson's album Sleep Through the Static‚Äîremained on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic also remained at number one on Billboard's Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia.[79][80] In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.[81][82]On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009,[83] and that former bassist Jason Newsted‚Äîwho left the band in 2001‚Äîwould perform with the band at the ceremony.[84] Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play because he "wanted to see the Black Album band".[85] However, during the band's set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage.[86] Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.[87]Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Warsaw Babice Airport, Warsaw, as a part of the Sonisphere Festival series. The show in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 22, 2010, was broadcast via satellite to cinemas.[88] The bands also played concerts in Bucharest on June 26, 2010, and Istanbul on June 27, 2010. On June 28, 2010, Death Magnetic was certified 2X platinum by the RIAA.[89]Metallica performing during its World Magnetic Tour in 2009Metallica's World Magnetic Tour ended in Melbourne on November 21, 2010. The band had been touring for over two years in support of Death Magnetic. To accompany the final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live, limited edition EP of past performances in Australia called Six Feet Down Under was released.[90] The EP was followed by Six Feet Down Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010.[91] Part 2 contains a further eight songs recorded during the first two Oceanic Legs of the World Magnetic Tour.On November 26, 2010, Metallica released a live EP titled Live at Grimey's, which was recorded in June 2008 at Grimey's Record Store, just before the band's appearance at Bonnaroo Music Festival that year.[92][93]In a June 2009 interview with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica was planning to continue touring until August 2010, and that there were no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[94] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[95] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[96]In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record‚Äîit's my hero‚Äîit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[97] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[98] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[99][100]On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

The album, which was titled Lulu, was recorded over several months and comprised ten songs[108] based on Frank Wedekind's "Lulu" plays Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box.[109] The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times; Lars Ulrich later said Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight".[110] On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material. He said, "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."[111]Metallica performing in Bangalore, India in 2011Metallica was due to make its first appearance in India at the "India Rocks" concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.[112] However, the concert was canceled when the venue was proven to be unsafe.[113] Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud.[114] Metallica made its Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011.[115][116] On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would headline the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, at the Download Festival at Donington Park and that the band would play the The Black Album in its entirety.[117] Metallica celebrated its 30th anniversary by playing four shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco in December 2011.

"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion.

See media help.Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions.[155] New wave of British heavy metal bands Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[156] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[157] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[157] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs‚Äîamong other themes‚Äîwere explored on Master of Puppets.[158]In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[159] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[160] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load‚Äîan album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach‚Äîthe band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[161] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza.[48] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[48] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[161]St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[65] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[162][163] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[164] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[165]Legacy and influenceMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[166] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide,[167] including an RIAA-certified 66&#160;million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the U.S., making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[168][169] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[170] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[171]Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[172] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old‚ÄîI'd never heard anything that heavy".[173] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets‚Äîand the staying power‚Äîa timeless record like that".[174] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[175][176] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica".[177] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[178] Ill Ni√±o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[179] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[180]Kerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium‚Äîall of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on The Simpsons' eighteenth season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".[181] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series Metalocalypse.[182] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[183]MTV ranked Metallica the third "Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History",[172] was listed fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock,[184] and the band was number one on VH1's 20 Greatest Metal Bands list.[185] Rolling Stone placed the band 61st on its list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time";[186] its albums Master of Puppets and Metallica were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[187] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time",[188] and was ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums",[189] and number one on Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list.[190] "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".[191]On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame.

The band was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. Metallica's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. The band expanded its musical direction and achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which resulted in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. The album was also their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, a success that they also achieved on their following four studio albums. In 2000, Metallica joined with other artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material without consent from the band. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. The release of St. Anger (2003) alienated fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum, and a film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. The band returned to its original musical style with the release of Death Magnetic (2008), and in 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide.[1] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] As of December 2012, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S.[3][4] Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced four of the band's studio albums between 1990 and 2003 and served as a temporary bassist during the production of St. Anger. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. The band is currently promoting its tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which is expected to be released on November 18, 2016.[5]Contents1 History1.1 Formation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)1.2 Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)1.3 Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)1.4 ...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)1.5 Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)1.6 Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)1.7 Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)1.8 Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2012‚Äìpresent)2 Style and lyrical themes3 Legacy and influence4 Band members4.1 Timeline5 Awards6 Discography7 See also8 Notes9 References10 Sources11 External linksHistoryFormation and early years (1981‚Äì1982)The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases and their last two albums, as well as Guitar Hero: MetallicaMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[6] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[6] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[7]Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[6] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[8] Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[9] The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.The term "thrash metal" was coined by Kerrang!'s journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang!'s issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[10] Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[11] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[11]Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[12]Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1985)In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[12]Dave Mustaine went on to found rival band Megadeth after being released from the band in 1983.Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[15] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.&#160;1 guitarist in your magazine".[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[11]Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[19][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[20] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[21] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[22]Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200.[23] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[22]Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band as a client of Q-Prime Management.[24] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released Creeping Death as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record‚Äîcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"‚Äîappeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[25] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[24]Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986‚Äì1987)Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[26] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[27] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[28] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[24] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[29]On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D√∂rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[29]Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[30] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[30]After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space‚Äîa suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"‚Äîand relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[31][32]Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[33]...And Justice for All and Metallica (1988‚Äì1993)Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored‚Äîthough he received writing credit for the track "Blackened".[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]Metallica performing during its Damaged Justice tour in 1988In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, was hired as the producer. Metallica‚Äîalso known as The Black Album‚Äîwas remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages.[42] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[43] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[44] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[42] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[45] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[45]On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7&#160;m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger".[46] Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour; Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[46]Load, Reload, Garage Inc. and S&amp;M (1994‚Äì1999)After almost three years of touring to promote the album Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[23] The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[47] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.[35][48]James Hetfield performing with the band during its Load tour in 1996During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[47] Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[23] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable.[49] To promote Reload, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[50]In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.[50][51]On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[23]Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2000‚Äì2005)Main article: Metallica v. Napster, Inc.In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[52] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[53]Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[52] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[54] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94&#160;million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[55] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[56]At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[35]Robert Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 during the recording of St. Anger.In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[60] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[60] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4&#160;pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[49] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[49]For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[49] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse‚Äîamong others‚Äîauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[49] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[61]Metallica performing during its Madly in Anger with the World Tour in 2004In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess".[64] However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking".[65] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69]Death Magnetic, Lulu and Beyond Magnetic (2006‚Äì2011)In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989‚Äì2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[71] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[75] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[76]Death Magnetic debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200.[77] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[78]Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose album‚Äîthe other being Jack Johnson's album Sleep Through the Static‚Äîremained on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic also remained at number one on Billboard's Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia.[79][80] In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.[81][82]On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009,[83] and that former bassist Jason Newsted‚Äîwho left the band in 2001‚Äîwould perform with the band at the ceremony.[84] Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play because he "wanted to see the Black Album band".[85] However, during the band's set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage.[86] Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.[87]Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Warsaw Babice Airport, Warsaw, as a part of the Sonisphere Festival series. The show in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 22, 2010, was broadcast via satellite to cinemas.[88] The bands also played concerts in Bucharest on June 26, 2010, and Istanbul on June 27, 2010.

The band had been touring for over two years in support of Death Magnetic. To accompany the final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live, limited edition EP of past performances in Australia called Six Feet Down Under was released.[90] The EP was followed by Six Feet Down Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010.[91] Part 2 contains a further eight songs recorded during the first two Oceanic Legs of the World Magnetic Tour.On November 26, 2010, Metallica released a live EP titled Live at Grimey's, which was recorded in June 2008 at Grimey's Record Store, just before the band's appearance at Bonnaroo Music Festival that year.[92][93]In a June 2009 interview with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica was planning to continue touring until August 2010, and that there were no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[94] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[95] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[96]In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record‚Äîit's my hero‚Äîit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[97] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[98] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[99][100]On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

See media help.Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions.[155] New wave of British heavy metal bands Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[156] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[157] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[157] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs‚Äîamong other themes‚Äîwere explored on Master of Puppets.[158]In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[159] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[160] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load‚Äîan album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach‚Äîthe band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[161] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza.[48] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[48] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[161]St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[65] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[162][163] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[164] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[165]Legacy and influenceMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[166] The band has sold more than 110 million records worldwide,[167] including an RIAA-certified 66&#160;million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 53,642,000 in the U.S., making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[168][169] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[170] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[171]Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[172] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old‚ÄîI'd never heard anything that heavy".[173] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets‚Äîand the staying power‚Äîa timeless record like that".[174] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[175][176] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica".[177] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[178] Ill Ni√±o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[179] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[180]Kerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets.

Godsmack Feature Interview At Blistering.com																																								-->			        			  			   	&raquo; Home &raquo; FeaturesGodsmackBy: James WrightWhat do you do when your band debuts at #1, you have multi-platinum records, and youíre touring the world with Metallica? If your band is Godsmack then you step outside the genre your band is notorious for and record an acoustic EP.The Other Side is an exploration in melody and beauty as the album trades Godsmackís trademark sonic assault for acoustics and harmony. Taking a cue from the late great Alice In Chains ala Jar Of Flies, Godsmack is determined to let the world know that there is more to their music than just aggression.Just prior to The Other Side being certified Gold, Blistering.com spoke with drummer Shannon Larkin about the album, touring with Metallica and all things in-between.Blistering.com: This EP, The Other Side, was recorded in Hawaii. Was this more of a working vacation for the band?Shannon: Well, Sully had written these songs before we did Faceless but they didnít fit in with what we were trying to do on that record. The label really liked those songs and at the end of the first leg of the Faceless tour we were in Japan. On our way home, we stopped in Hawaii because it is halfway between Japan and the United States. We basically had a 17-day vacation that the label paid for but we did a record while we were there. Weíve been so surprised at the reaction to this record because itís just an EP. The intent of this whole record was just to put out something that we thought the longtime fans might like to hear and that was Godsmack stripped down. When you play the style of hard rock that we play itís just a wall of guitars and drums that donít really allow the vocals to shine through like an acoustic song can. We had no clue that it would come out and sell so well; it debuted at something like #4 on the Billboard Charts. Blistering.com: Is it amazing to see that your band is up there on the charts with all the mega-pop superstars?Shannon: Not only that but itís surreal. We come out and we know we have a huge fanbase because Faceless debuted at #1, but to have an acoustic EP do so well kinda threw us for a loop.Blistering.com: Were you ever worried that long time fans may not embrace the softer elements of Godsmackís music?Shannon: We figured that if we let people know that this was an acoustic thing and like the album says, this is ìthe other sideî of Godsmack, we figured as long as we let fans know that and that we werenít going to turn soft on them. The 4th record is gonna be a heavy record. We werenít worried about people going out buying this and thinking it was a heavy record. Even the album cover lets people know that itís more of an acoustic record. It is an acoustic record but itís still dark and creepy. Donít get me wrong because I love heavy music but an acoustic song like ëAsleepí, the re-make of ëAwakeí, that doesnít even have any drums on it, is so heavy and intense. That is the heaviest song on the record just because of the places it takes me. Heavy doesnít have to be fast and loud all the time. Blistering.com: I heard someone in the past say that the true sign of a great song is one that can transcend genres or go from loud to acoustic. Do you think that holds true for this record?Shannon: Wow, Iíve never heard that before - what an interesting little tidbit. Well I must say that that makes sense because a great song is a great song. Thatís funny because Iíve never heard that before. Letís think of a great song... Like ëMountain Songí by Janeís Addiction and I bet you that the song would be every bit as awesome if they did it acoustically. Thatís actually a pretty profound statement.Blistering.com: This record is very reminiscent of Alice In Chainsí Jar Of Flies album.Shannon: Well, Alice In Chains is a huge Sully Erna influence and a lot of people compare Godsmack to Alice in Chains. I myself donít really see the comparison, maybe on the first record there are a couple of songs with a groove that may sound like Alice In Chains, but his voice definitely does not sound like Layne Staley. Now you listen to Dropbox and that kid sounds just like Layne!Blistering.com: I had the chance to hear their record and itís pretty good. Definitely Alice In Chains influenced but I also hear old Soundgarden, even at times Mother Love Bone.Shannon: You know what I hear in that shit? The guitars remind me of Southern rock kinda like a Black Label Society thing.Blistering.com: So with them being out on the road with you is it like youíre looking out for them, showing them the ropes?Shannon: Absolutely. Itís been like that since the very first time those guys came out with us. The guitar player for Dropbox, Lee Richards, was actually the first guitar player in Godsmack - he had some kids and had to quit the band to raise them. Godsmack got another guitar player and blew up and during that time Sully had met this singer John Koscko, who Sully thought had a great voice but hated his band at the time. He hooked Lee and Jon up together and they formed Dropbox, who are the first signing to Sullyís label Realign Records. Their first show was at a Godsmack Grammy party out in L.A and that was their first time on stage as a band and then the next time they performed was with us on out headlining dates. Metallica takes about 2-weeks off in between tours and we really didnít want to take off that much time so we threw together a headline tour with Dropbox on their first tour. Imagine being in a band and this famous singer signs your band and wants to take you out on tour! Weíre kind of experiencing that right now with Metallica because we were slated to do only 3-weeks in Europe with them, no American dates at all. Luckily they loved us and after 2-weeks they asked us to do the first leg of the U.S tour with them, so of course we said, ìHell yes!î Then after the first leg was over they asked us to do another leg with them because Lars came into our dressing room and was like, ìWhy donít you just finish this whole tour with us?î.Blistering.com: It must be kind of hard to say no to that.Shannon: We would tour anywhere with Metallica. We would do a tour of Pakistan with them! (Laughs) This is the biggest tour that Godsmack has done to date. They only other thing that can even compare is opening for Black Sabbath. Weíre probably averaging 17,000 a night and when we go on there are probably 12-14,000 already in their seats; the arenas are pretty much full when we go on. Itís pretty amazing because weíve had this huge band take us under their wing and itís helped so much because in this day and age to expand musically is hard enough without doing it in front of a huge crowd. Metallica has probably been the biggest influence on this band and Iím not just saying that because weíre friends with them now but they really changed my life when I was 16 years old - Iíd never heard anything that heavy. Weíve definitely been re-influenced by Metallica now in attitude if nothing else.Blistering.com: What is it like adjusting to home life after being on the road virtually non-stop?Shannon: Itís kind of like one giant decompression for like the first two or three days. Youíre always thinking that youíre going to miss something or that youíre missing an interview. It takes a couple days to adjust which in the grand scheme of things isnít so bad.Blistering.com: By any chance would you do an acoustic tour?Shannon: Well if thereís a demand for it then weíll do it but we really need some time off to focus on our 4th record. Weíre just starting to put riffs on tape now and lay down some rough ideas but before we even get together we all need some time off from one another. Not that thereís any turmoil or anything like that but after living in a tube together for over a year we all need to have some time off so we come back energized so we can create together. Weíre going to take the summer months of June/July off and then do a good 3-months again in the U.S with Metallica and after that weíll probably take off the winter months as well. If the demand is still there and The Other Side has sold enough copies, then weíll go out and do some shows where itís just an evening with Godsmack. No opening band, no pyro, just us, some candles, tapestries and us on some stools playing acoustically.Blistering.com: I know you were previously in Amen with Casey Chaos, what are your thoughts on the new Amen record?Shannon: Itís a brilliant record man! I tracked about 90% on the drums on that record because Casey and I remain friends even after I left Amen, so weíd head down to the Valley and record songs with him. The thing about Casey is that heís a songwriting machine and he never stops writing songs. We ended up recording about 30 odd songs together and they ended up being the songs he used on the record. I think itís great and Iíve always loved Amen. I wish them the best of luck and I know itís not designed to be this big commercial success; itís hardcore band. Everyone into intense music should buy Amen.Blistering.com: So right now is the mindset in the group all about the 4th record?Shannon: Well let me just say that our 4th record is going to be a heavy record, Iíll tell you that. The next record will be a bluesier, heavier record maybe even thanìFaceless was. We still want to continue in the same direction that we were going in with Faceless, with big lead guitars and I think Sully has pretty much found his niche vocally. I think with this acoustic thing Sully really found his voice. Our intent is to let our fans know that just because we put out an acoustic EP, that doesnít mean weíre going soft.

Sie wurde 1981 in Los Angeles gegr√ºndet und ist seit 1982 in San Francisco ans√§ssig.[1] Sie geh√∂rt zu den erfolgreichsten Metalbands der Welt und hat bislang √ºber 110&#160;Millionen Alben verkauft.[2] Allein in den USA verkaufte die Band √ºber 62&#160;Millionen Alben[3] und ist damit die siebterfolgreichste K√ºnstlergruppe des Landes.[4] Metallica wurde neunmal mit einem Grammy Award ausgezeichnet.[5]Neben Slayer, Megadeth und Anthrax z√§hlte Metallica in den 1980er Jahren zu den ‚Äûgro√üen Vier‚Äú des Thrash Metal und gilt als die einflussreichste Metal-Band dieses Jahrzehnts.[6] W√§hrend der 1990er-Jahre √∂ffnete sich Metallica neuen musikalischen Einfl√ºssen wie Bluesrock[7] und anderen Rockstilen,[8] womit sie ein breiteres Publikum ansprach und zugleich ihre bisherigen Fans irritierte, bevor die Band ab 2002 wieder zu ihren musikalischen Wurzeln zur√ºckkehrte.Inhaltsverzeichnis1 Bandgeschichte1.1 Anf√§nge (1981‚Äì1983)1.2 Kill ‚ÄôEm All und Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1984)1.3 Master of Puppets und Cliff Burtons Tod (1985‚Äì1986)1.4 ‚Ä¶And Justice for All (1987‚Äì1990)1.5 Metallica ‚Äì das schwarze Album (1990‚Äì1993)1.6 Load und ReLoad (1994‚Äì1997)1.7 Garage Inc. und S&amp;M (1997‚Äì1999)1.8 Die Napster-Kontroverse und Newsteds Ausstieg (2000‚Äì2001)1.9 St. Anger (2002‚Äì2005)1.10 Death Magnetic (2006‚Äì2010)1.11 Lulu und Hardwired...

Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden‚Äú‚Äì Anzeige im ‚ÄûRecycler‚Äú[9]Der Rhythmusgitarrist und S√§nger James Hetfield und der Bassist Ron McGovney luden Ulrich daraufhin in ihren Proberaum ein und spielten einige Coverversionen von Judas-Priest-Liedern. Da Hetfield und McGovney Ulrich f√ºr einen schlechten Schlagzeuger hielten, trennten sich die Wege der Musiker vorerst wieder. Ulrich freundete sich derweil mit Brian Slagel an, der das Metalfanzine ‚ÄûHeavy Metal Revue‚Äú herausgab und mit Metal Blade Records eine eigene Plattenfirma gegr√ºndet hatte. Dessen erste Ver√∂ffentlichung sollte der Sampler Metal Massacre mit lokalen Bands werden. Obwohl Ulrich selbst noch keine Band hatte, bat er Slagel um einen Platz auf dem Sampler. Nachdem er die Zusage erhalten hatte, nahm er wieder Kontakt zu Hetfield auf und gr√ºndete die Band.[9]Lars Ulrich live im Jahr 2008Ulrich und Hetfield beschlossen im Folgenden, ihre erste Eigenkomposition Hit the Lights f√ºr den Sampler zu verwenden. Mit einer weiteren Anzeige suchte die Band nach einem Leadgitarristen, man wurde mit dem Jamaikaner Lloyd Grant f√ºndig. Nach Abschluss der Aufnahmen meldete sich der Gitarrist Dave Mustaine, der schlie√ülich an Stelle von Grant in die Band aufgenommen wurde. Aus Zeitgr√ºnden fand jedoch die Version mit Grants Solo ihren Weg auf die erste Auflage des Samplers. F√ºr den Sampler brauchte man kurzfristig einen Bandnamen; die Vorschl√§ge Thunderfuck, Helldriver, Grinder, Blitzer, Red Vette, Deathchamber und Flying Tigers wurden verworfen.Das von Hetfield entworfene und √ºber lange Zeit genutzte BandlogoZu ihrem Namen kam die Band durch Ulrichs Freund Ron Quintana. Dieser war auf der Suche nach einem Namen f√ºr sein Fanzine und hatte Ulrich eine Liste mit m√∂glichen Namen vorgelegt. Der darauf befindliche Name Metallica gefiel Ulrich so sehr, dass er Quintana √ºberredete, sein Fanzine ‚ÄûMetal Mania‚Äú zu nennen und so Metallica als Vorschlag f√ºr seine eigene Band √ºbernehmen zu k√∂nnen. Ulrichs Bandkollegen reagierten begeistert und Hetfield entwarf das dazugeh√∂rige Bandlogo.[10] Am 14. M√§rz 1982 spielte Metallica ihr erstes Konzert in der Radio City Hall in Anaheim. Einen Monat sp√§ter nahm die Band ihr erstes Demo Power Metal auf, dessen Name von der beigelegten Visitenkarte abgeleitet wurde. Der Metal Massacre-Sampler erschien am 14. Juni 1982. Wegen eines Druckfehlers wurde die Band als Mettallica angek√ºndigt.[11] Im Juli 1982 nahm die Band ihr zweites Demo No Life ‚ÄôTil Leather auf, das in der Undergroundszene der San Francisco Bay Area euphorisch aufgenommen wurde.Im Herbst 1982 verlie√ü McGovney die Band. Sein Nachfolger wurde Cliff Burton, der seine ehemalige Band Trauma zu Gunsten von Metallica verlie√ü. Burton stellte jedoch die Bedingung, dass die restlichen Metallica-Mitglieder zu ihm nach San Francisco umziehen m√ºssten. Zur gleichen Zeit gelangte das No Life ‚ÄôTil Leather-Demo in die H√§nde des ehemaligen B√∂rsenspekulanten John Zazula. Er kontaktierte die Band und verschaffte ihr Auftrittsm√∂glichkeiten an der Ostk√ºste. Da die Streitigkeiten mit Dave Mustaine √ºberhandnahmen, beschlossen Ulrich, Hetfield und Burton noch auf der Reise nach New York, Mustaine aus der Band zu werfen.[10]Dave Mustaine musste die Band 1983 nach Streitigkeiten verlassenNeuer Leadgitarrist wurde Kirk Hammett, der zuvor bei Exodus gespielt hatte. Am 16. April 1983 fand in Dover das erste Metallica-Konzert mit Hammett statt. Die Band wohnte zu dieser Zeit in einem alten New Yorker Fabrikgeb√§ude, in dem Anthrax ihren Proberaum hatten.‚ÄûManchmal rissen wir M√§dels auf und gingen mit ihnen nach Hause, damit wir zumindest mal duschen konnten. Wir k√§mpften wirklich ums nackte √úberleben, aber r√ºckblickend war es eine sch√∂ne Zeit.‚Äú‚Äì James Hetfield[10]Zazula bem√ºhte sich, f√ºr Metallica einen Plattenvertrag zu besorgen. Da er von allen Firmen nur Absagen erhielt, gr√ºndete er eine eigene Plattenfirma, die er auf Burtons Vorschlag hin Megaforce Records nannte.Kill ‚ÄôEm All und Ride the Lightning (1983‚Äì1984)Zazula lieh sich 12.000 Dollar und finanzierte der Band Studiozeit in den Music America Studios in Rochester. Da Hetfield immer noch Zweifel an seinem Gesangstalent hatte, dachte die Band √ºber die Verpflichtung eines festen S√§ngers nach. Jess Cox von den Tygers of Pan Tang war nach Meinung der Band zu alt, w√§hrend Armored Saint-S√§nger John Bush das Angebot ausschlug. So ging die Band zu viert die Aufnahmen an, die innerhalb von 17 Tagen durchgezogen wurden. Auch wenn Dave Mustaine nicht mehr Bandmitglied war, befinden sich vier von ihm mitkomponierte Lieder auf dem Album. Urspr√ºnglich sollte das Album Metal Up Your Ass hei√üen und das Cover einen aus einer Toilette auftauchenden Dolch zeigen. Zazulas Vertriebspartner Relativity lehnte beides ab.Als Burton trotzig ‚ÄûWell, let‚Äôs kill ‚Äôem all!‚Äú rief, schlugen Metallica Kill ‚ÄôEm All als Albumtitel vor. Dieser Titel wurde von Relativity problemlos angenommen. Das Album wurde am 25. Juli 1983 ver√∂ffentlicht und verkaufte sich in den USA zun√§chst schleppend. Dagegen wurde Metallica in England als Band der Stunde gefeiert. Als Vorgruppe von Raven gingen Metallica auf eine f√ºnfw√∂chige Tournee durch die USA. Bis Ende 1983 hatte sich Kill ‚ÄôEm All in den USA etwa 17.000 Mal verkauft.[10] W√§hrend der Konzertreisen schrieb die Band neue Lieder, die progressiver und langsamer als die des Deb√ºtalbums ausfielen. Im Vorprogramm von Venom spielten Metallica seine ersten Konzerte in Europa.Aufgrund des g√ºnstigen Wechselkurses zwischen dem US-Dollar und der D√§nischen Krone fanden die Aufnahmen zum zweiten Studioalbum Ride the Lightning in den Sweet Silence-Studios der d√§nischen Hauptstadt Kopenhagen statt. Aus Kostengr√ºnden fanden die Aufnahmen in der Nacht statt. Textlich entfernte sich die Band von den √ºblichen Metalklischees. So handelt z.B. das Lied Creeping Death vom Auszug der Israeliten aus der √§gyptischen Sklaverei. Ride the Lightning wurde in Gro√übritannien mit einer Silbernen Schallplatte ausgezeichnet.[10] Ende 1984 spielten Metallica ihre erste Headlinertour durch Europa.Master of Puppets und Cliff Burtons Tod (1985‚Äì1986)Metallica wurde vom Major-Label Elektra Records unter Vertrag genommen und erhielt mit Q Prime ein professionelles Management. Ride the Lightning wurde in den USA neu ver√∂ffentlicht und erreichte ohne Radioairplay Platz 100 der US-amerikanischen Albumcharts. Anfang 1985 spielte Metallica weitere US-Touren mit W.A.S.P. und Armored Saint, bevor man an neuen Liedern arbeitete. Im August 1985 spielte die Band erstmals beim Monsters of Rock im Donington Park.[12]Im September 1985 kehrte die Band in die Sweet Silence Studios zur√ºck, um mit den Aufnahmen ihres dritten Albums Master of Puppets zu beginnen. Von ihrer Plattenfirma erhielten sie einen hohen Vorschuss, weswegen Metallica kurzzeitig dar√ºber nachdachte, den durch seine Arbeiten mit Iron Maiden bekannten Martin Birch als Produzenten zu verpflichten. Man entschied sich jedoch, erneut mit Flemming Rasmussen zusammenzuarbeiten. Die Aufnahmen dauerten insgesamt drei Monate und wurden nur durch einen Auftritt beim Loreley-Festival in Deutschland unterbrochen.[10]Master of Puppets wurde im M√§rz 1986 ver√∂ffentlicht und erreichte Platz 29 der US-Albumcharts. Bereits einen Monat sp√§ter erhielt das Album eine Goldene Schallplatte.[13] Metallica ging als Vorgruppe von Ozzy Osbourne auf Tournee durch Nordamerika. Vor dem Konzert in Evansville brach sich Hetfield beim Skateboardfahren das Handgelenk. Hetfield beschr√§nkte sich bei einigen Konzerten auf das Singen, w√§hrend der Gitarrentechniker John Marshall (sp√§ter Metal Church) die Rhythmusgitarre spielte.[14]Im Herbst 1986 ging Metallica zusammen mit Anthrax auf Europatournee. Am 27. September 1986 befand sich der Tourtross auf dem Weg von Stockholm nach Kopenhagen. In der N√§he von Ljungby kam der Bus von Metallica auf der vereisten Stra√üe ins Schleudern und √ºberschlug sich. Dabei wurde Burton aus seiner Koje ins Freie geschleudert, bevor der Bus auf ihn st√ºrzte.Gedenkstein f√ºr Cliff Burton‚ÄûIch riss den Notausgang auf und kletterte in Unterw√§sche nach drau√üen in die eisige K√§lte. [‚Ä¶] Ein paar unserer Crewmitglieder liefen schon um den Bus herum, um abzuchecken, was genau passiert war. Ich h√∂re Kirk [Hammett] aus dem Inneren ‚ÄöWas ist denn los?‚Äò rufen, und dann drehte ich mich um und sah Cliffs [Burtons] Beine unter dem Fahrzeug hervorragen.‚Äú‚Äì James Hetfield[10]Eine Autopsie ergab, dass Burtons Brustkorb eingedr√ºckt und die Lunge zerquetscht worden war. Die anderen Businsassen kamen mit leichten Verletzungen davon. Gl√ºck im Ungl√ºck hatte Kirk Hammett, der zuvor immer in Burtons Koje geschlafen hatte. Vor der Reise nach Kopenhagen hatte die Band beschlossen, mithilfe von Spielkarten die Kojen neu zu verteilen. Burton zog das Pik-Ass und w√§hlte Hammetts Koje am Fenster.[10] Burton wurde am 7. Oktober 1986 in Castro Valley beigesetzt.Zwei Wochen sp√§ter begann die Band mit der Suche nach einem Nachfolger. Vom Wunschkandidaten Joey Vera (Armored Saint) erhielt Metallica eine Absage. Etwa 40 Bassisten, darunter Les Claypool (Primus) und Greg Christian (Testament) spielten vor. Den Zuschlag erhielt Jason Newsted, der sich mit seiner alten Band Flotsam and Jetsam den Ruf eines exzellenten Songwriters erarbeitet hatte.[10]‚Ä¶And Justice for All (1987‚Äì1990)Am 8. November 1986 spielte Metallica in Reseda sein erstes Konzert mit Newsted am Bass. Nach einer kurzen Tour durch Japan und Kanada holte die Band ab Januar 1987 die wegen Burtons Unfalltod ausgefallenen Konzerte in Europa nach, was auch zwei Konzerte im damals noch kommunistisch regierten Polen beinhaltete.[10] Im M√§rz 1987 brach sich Hetfield erneut das Handgelenk beim Skateboardfahren, weshalb die Band ihren Auftritt bei der Fernsehshow Saturday Night Live absagen musste. Nach Hetfields Genesung wurde in Ulrichs Garage die EP Garage Days Re-Revisited aufgenommen, die Coverversionen von Diamond Head, Holocaust, Killing Joke, Budgie und den Misfits enth√§lt.Ab Oktober 1987 begann die Band mit den Vorbereitungen f√ºr ihr viertes Studioalbum ‚Ä¶And Justice for All. Da Flemming Rasmussen anderweitig besch√§ftigt war, suchte die Band nach einem neuen Produzenten. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Mike Clink, der kurz zuvor das Guns N‚Äô Roses-Deb√ºt Appetite for Destruction produzierte, entpuppte sich als Fehler, so dass Ulrich Rasmussen dr√§ngte, seine Produktionen schnellstm√∂glich durchzuziehen.[10] ‚Ä¶And Justice for All wurde im August 1988 ver√∂ffentlicht und erreichte Platz 6 der US-amerikanischen Charts. An Halloween wurde das Album mit Platin ausgezeichnet. Kritisch betrachtet wurde ‚Ä¶And Justice for All allerdings wegen des klinisch-k√ºhlen Klanges und wegen des fast v√∂llig ausgeblendeten Bassspieles von Jason Newsted.[10]Nachdem sich die Band zuvor jahrelang gegen das Drehen eines Musikvideos str√§ubte, wurde dieses Mal f√ºr das Lied ‚ÄûOne‚Äú ein Video erstellt, das Ausz√ºge aus Dalton Trumbos Film Johnny zieht in den Krieg enth√§lt. MTV nahm das Video in die t√§gliche Rotation und die Single erreichte die Top 40 der US-Charts. Metallica wurden f√ºr den Grammy in der Kategorie ‚ÄûBest Hard Rock/Metal Performance‚Äú nominiert, jedoch ging der Preis an Jethro Tull. Die Band reagierte mit Humor und versah einen Teil der ‚Ä¶And-Justice-for-All-Auflage mit einem Aufkleber mit der Aufschrift ‚ÄûGrammy Award Losers‚Äú.[10] Die Tour zum ‚Ä¶And-Justice-for-All-Album umfasste insgesamt 230 Konzerte und dauerte bis Oktober 1989. Anschlie√üend nahm sich Metallica eine Auszeit und spielte nur vereinzelt Konzerte.Metallica ‚Äì das schwarze Album (1990‚Äì1993)Im Februar 1990 erhielt die Band ihren ersten Grammy in der Kategorie ‚ÄûBest Metal Performance‚Äú f√ºr das Lied ‚ÄûOne‚Äú, bevor im Oktober 1990 die Aufnahmen f√ºr das f√ºnfte Studioalbum begannen. Aus einem von Kirk Hammett geschriebenen Riff entwickelt sich das Lied ‚ÄûEnter Sandman‚Äú, das zum Wegweiser f√ºr das gesamte Album werden sollte. Die Band strebte einfachere Lieder an, die schneller auf den Punkt kommen. Zu diesem Zwecke fragte Metallica den Kanadier Bob Rock, der zuvor mit Aerosmith, Bon Jovi und M√∂tley Cr√ºe gearbeitet hatte, ob er das neue Album mischen m√∂chte. Schlie√ülich sollte Rock das gesamte Album produzieren. Insgesamt ein Jahr verbrachte die Band im Studio. Die gesamten Aufnahmen kosteten eine Million US-Dollar und f√ºhrten bei drei Bandmitgliedern zur Ehescheidung.[15]‚ÄûEs war das schwierigste Album, das wir je gemacht haben. Irgendwann war klar, dass es verdammt gut werden w√ºrde, aber ich habe Bob [Rock] trotzdem gehasst und hinterher ein Jahr lang nicht mit ihm geredet. [‚Ä¶] Als wir uns schlie√ülich von den Strapazen erholt hatten, wurden wir jedoch gute Freunde.‚Äú‚Äì Lars Ulrich[10]‚ÄûEnter Sandman‚Äú wurde als erste Single ausgekoppelt und erreichte Platz 9 der deutschen Singlecharts.[16] Das selbstbetitelte Album wurde am 12. August 1991 ver√∂ffentlicht und stieg auf Platz eins der US-amerikanischen Albumcharts ein. Alleine in der ersten Woche wurden nur in den USA √ºber 650.000 Alben verkauft.[17] Durch Metallica konnte die Band neue Fanschichten au√üerhalb der Metalszene erschlie√üen. Bis heute verkaufte sich das Album in den USA √ºber 15 Millionen Mal.[13] Die Ballade ‚ÄûNothing Else Matters‚Äú avancierte zum Lieblingslied vieler Hochzeitspaare und erhielt massives Airplay in den Mainstreammedien.[10]Im Sp√§tsommer 1991 begann die ‚ÄûWherever We May Roam‚Äú-Tournee. Zun√§chst spielte Metallica als Co-Headliner vor AC/DC beim ‚ÄûMonsters of Rock‚Äú-Festival, bevor die Band zusammen mit AC/DC und Pantera vor gesch√§tzt 500.000 Menschen auf dem Flugplatz in Tuschino bei Moskau auftrat. Es folgte eine Hallentournee durch Nordamerika, bei der die Band ihre B√ºhne in der Mitte der Halle aufbauen lie√ü. In der Mitte der B√ºhne wurde der so genannte ‚ÄûSnake Pit‚Äú (engl.: ‚ÄûSchlangengrube‚Äú) eingerichtet, in dem etwa 200 Fans die Konzerte verfolgen konnten. Die Band unterbrach die Tournee und er√∂ffnete am 20. April 1992 das Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert im Londoner Wembley-Stadion.[10]James HetfieldZusammen mit Guns N‚Äô Roses spielte Metallica im Sommer 1992 eine Stadiontour durch Nordamerika. Beide Bands spielten zweieinhalbst√ºndige Konzerte, wobei Guns N‚Äô Roses darauf bestand, nach Metallica auf die B√ºhne zu gehen. Am 8. August 1992 spielten beide Bands im Olympiastadion von Montreal. W√§hrend des Liedes ‚ÄûFade to Black‚Äú geriet Hetfield in eine sechs Meter hohe Flammens√§ule und erlitt dabei Verbrennungen zweiten Grades. Axl Rose sagte wegen angeblicher Halsschmerzen das Konzert von Guns N‚Äô Roses ab und l√∂ste dadurch Ausschreitungen unter den aufgebrachten Zuschauern aus.[10] Bei den folgenden Metallica-Konzerten √ºbernahm wegen Hetfields Verbrennungen erneut John Marshall die Rhythmus-Gitarre. Der Tourzyklus zog sich bis zum Juli 1993 hin, wodurch die vier Musiker psychisch und physisch ausgelaugt waren. Ende 1993 ver√∂ffentlichte Metallica mit Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge sein erstes Boxset, das u.&#160;a. drei Live-CDs und zwei Live-Videos enthielt.Load und ReLoad (1994‚Äì1997)Abgesehen von einer dreimonatigen Tour durch Nordamerika inklusive eines Headlinerauftritts beim Woodstock II-Festival zogen sich die Metallica-Bandmitglieder w√§hrend des Jahres 1994 aus der √ñffentlichkeit zur√ºck und k√ºmmerten sich um ihre Familien. Im Oktober begann die Band mit dem Schreiben neuer Lieder. Die Aufnahmen begannen im Mai 1995. Aufgrund der schlechten Erfahrungen w√§hrend der Aufnahmen zum schwarzen Album wollte sich die Band dieses Mal keinen Stress machen und legte regelm√§√üig Pausen ein.[10] Nach einem Auftritt als Headliner des Monsters-of-Rock-Festivals spielten Metallica am 3. September 1995 ein Konzert in Tuktoyaktuk, der n√∂rdlichsten Gemeinde auf dem kanadischen Festland. Zahlreiche √ñlheizungen waren n√∂tig, damit die Instrumente √ºberhaupt funktionierten. Anl√§sslich des 50. Geburtstages von Mot√∂rhead-S√§nger Lemmy Kilmister spielte Metallica in Los Angeles unter dem Decknamen ‚ÄûThe Lemmys‚Äú ein Konzert, bei dem ausschlie√ülich Mot√∂rheadlieder gecovert wurden.[18]Insgesamt 27 Lieder wurden aufgenommen und die Band plante die Ver√∂ffentlichung eines Doppelalbums. Stattdessen wurden die Lieder auf zwei Alben verteilt, die innerhalb von eineinhalb Jahren auf den Markt gebracht wurden. Den Anfang machte im Juni 1996 Load. Das vom Provokationsk√ºnstler Andres Serrano entworfene Albumcover zeigt eine Mischung aus Serranos Sperma und Rinderblut, das er zwischen zwei Scheiben Plexiglas presste. Die neue musikalische Ausrichtung der Band, die Einfl√ºsse aus Country und Blues aufzeigte, wurde von vielen Fans ebenso kontrovers diskutiert wie die Kurzhaarschnitte der Bandmitglieder.‚ÄûF√ºr mich liegt der Metal in seiner altbekannten Form im Koma. Die Bands wiederholen sich und haben sich dadurch ihr eigenes Grab geschaufelt. Mal ehrlich: Wer braucht schon die zehnte Version ein- und desselben Albums, das beispielsweise Running Wild Jahr f√ºr Jahr neu einspielen? [‚Ä¶] Heavy Metal ist in seiner urspr√ºnglichen Form als rebellische, frische Untergrundbewegung sinnentleert.‚Äú‚Äì Lars Ulrich[10]Metallica nahm als Headliner an der Lollapalooza-Tour teil. W√§hrend dieser Tour reiste Jason Newsted in einem eigenen Bus, in dem ein mobiles Tonstudio eingebaut war. Zusammen mit Exodus-Schlagzeuger Tom Hunting und Devin Townsend gr√ºndete er das Projekt ‚ÄûIR8‚Äú (Synonym f√ºr das englische Adjektiv irate = zornig, w√ºtend) und nahm ein Demo auf. Insbesondere James Hetfield nahm diesen Ansatz zur Nebent√§tigkeit √ºbel, w√§hrend Newsted sich darauf berief, bei Metallica als Songschreiber nicht erw√ºnscht und daher nicht ausgelastet zu sein. Bei den MTV Europe Video Music Awards 1996 spielte die Band statt ‚ÄûKing Nothing‚Äú ein Medley aus den Liedern ‚ÄûSo What‚Äú und ‚ÄûLast Caress‚Äú. Wegen des obsz√∂nen Textes von ‚ÄûSo What‚Äú[19] schnitt MTV Metallicas Auftritt bei allen Wiederholungen der Sendung heraus.[20]Im November 1997 erschien ReLoad. Das ebenfalls von Andres Serrano entworfene Albumcover enthielt dieses Mal eine Mischung aus Blut und Urin. Wie bereits Load stieg ReLoad auf Platz&#160;1 der US-amerikanischen Charts ein. Die erste Single ‚ÄûThe Memory Remains‚Äú beinhaltete ebenso wie der dazugeh√∂rige Videoclip einen Gastauftritt der britischen S√§ngerin und Schauspielerin Marianne Faithfull. Die Tournee zum Album fiel relativ kurz aus.Garage Inc. und S&amp;M (1997‚Äì1999)Ohne gr√∂√üere Vorbereitungen nahm die Band im Herbst 1998 elf Coverversionen von Bands und K√ºnstlern wie z.&#160;B. Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Bob Seger und Discharge auf. Zusammen mit allen bisher ver√∂ffentlichten Coverversionen kam das Album unter dem Namen Garage Inc. auf den Markt. Metallica wurde im M√§rz 1999 in den Walk of Fame in Los Angeles aufgenommen. Der damalige B√ºrgermeister Willie Brown proklamierte den 7. M√§rz 1999 zum ‚ÄûOffiziellen Metallica-Tag‚Äú.[21]Am 21. und 22. April 1999 nahm die Band zwei Auftritte mit dem San Francisco Symphony Orchestra unter Leitung von Michael Kamen auf. Kamen, der √ºber seine klassische Ausbildung und Erfolge als Filmkomponist hinaus √ºber gro√üe Erfahrungen bei der Umsetzung solcher Projekte verf√ºgte,[22] hatte die Streichinstrumente f√ºr das Lied Nothing Else Matters vom schwarzen Album arrangiert. Bereits damals versuchte Kamen die Band davon zu √ºberzeugen, ihre Musik einmal unter Begleitung eines Sinfonieorchesters aufzuf√ºhren. F√ºr den Auftritt komponierte die Band mit ‚ÄûNo Leaf Clover‚Äú und ‚Äû-Human‚Äú zwei neue Lieder.[10] Der Mitschnitt der Auff√ºhrung wurde im November 1999 unter dem Namen S&amp;M ver√∂ffentlicht. ‚ÄûNothing Else Matters‚Äú wurde als Single ver√∂ffentlicht und erreichte Platz 2 der deutschen Singlecharts. Weitere Auftritte mit Sinfonieorchestern fanden im November des Jahres in Berlin und New York City statt.Die Napster-Kontroverse und Newsteds Ausstieg (2000‚Äì2001)Exklusiv f√ºr den Film Mission: Impossible II nahm Metallica das Lied ‚ÄûI Disappear‚Äú auf. Nachdem die Band herausfand, dass eine Demoversion von verschiedenen Radiosendern gespielt wurde, stellte man fest, dass alle bisher ver√∂ffentlichten Titel der Band bei der Peer-to-Peer-Tauschb√∂rse Napster zum freien Download zur Verf√ºgung standen. Metallica verklagte Napster und die Universit√§ten von Southern California, Yale und Indiana daraufhin wegen Urheberrechtsverletzung und Verletzung des Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).[23] Als Reaktion blockierten Yale und Indiana Napster auf allen Computern, woraufhin Metallica die Klagen gegen beide Universit√§ten zur√ºckzog.[24]Mit Hilfe des Online-Dienstleisters ‚ÄûNetPD‚Äú wurde Napster eine 60.000 Seiten lange Liste mit 335.435 Benutzern vorgelegt, mit der Bitte, diese Benutzer zu verbannen.[25] Der Rapper Dr.&#160;Dre schloss sich Metallicas Klage an, so dass weitere 230.142 Benutzer von Napster verbannt wurden.[26]Lars Ulrich hinter seinem Schlagzeug 2004‚ÄûEs kr√§nkt uns zu wissen, dass unser Gut mehr wie eine Massenware und weniger als die Kunst, die es eigentlich ist, behandelt wird. Vom gesch√§ftlichen Standpunkt aus ist es reine Piraterie, etwas zu nehmen, das einem nicht geh√∂rt. Der Austausch solcher Informationen, ob es Musik, Videos oder Fotos sind, ist nichts anderes als der Handel mit gestohlenen Waren.‚Äú‚Äì Lars Ulrich[23]Napster begann darauf ab M√§rz 2001, Benutzer und Metallica-Lieder durch Aktivierung von Filtern anhand von Listen mit IP-Adressen zu sperren; im Juli zog die Band darauf ihre Copyright-Klage zur√ºck. In einem Yahoo-Chat im Jahr 2000 erkl√§rte Ulrich, dass die Band ‚ÄûNapster‚Äú ausschlie√ülich wegen der Verbreitung ihrer Studioalben verklagt hatte. Sie wollen aber weiterhin den Tausch selbst gemachter Live-Aufnahmen, sogenannter Bootlegs, erlauben.[27]Im Sommer 2000 ging die Band zusammen mit Korn, Kid Rock und System of a Down auf die ‚ÄûSummer Sanitarium‚Äú-Tour durch Nordamerika. Am 4. Juli 2000 st√ºrzte ein Fan w√§hrend des Konzerts in Baltimore vom Oberrang des PSINet Stadium und starb. Zwei Wochen sp√§ter verstarb ein anderer Fan w√§hrend eines Geheimkonzerts in Hollywood.[10]W√§hrend der ‚ÄûSummer Sanitarium‚Äú-Tour kapselte sich Newsted immer weiter von der Band ab. Auch zwischen Hetfield und Ulrich wuchsen die Spannungen. Auf Anraten ihres Managers beschloss die Band, den Psychologen Phil Towle zu engagieren. Bereits vor der ersten Sitzung hatte Newsted beschlossen, die Band zu verlassen. Offiziell wurde der Ausstieg damit begr√ºndet, dass Newsted seine Halswirbels√§ule durch sein exzessives Headbangen ruiniert habe.[28] Die wahren Beweggr√ºnde f√ºr Newsteds Ausstieg lagen jedoch woanders.Bereits seit 1996 arbeitete Newsted mit der Band Echobrain zusammen. Da Metallica eine l√§ngere Pause einlegen wollte, planten Echobrain, ein Album aufzunehmen. Hetfield war dagegen und stellte Newsteds Treue zur Band infrage.‚ÄûDie Band starb f√ºr mich am 27. September 2000. An diesem Tag stampfte mich James [Hetfield] in Grund und Boden. Er hatte zu der Zeit einen Haufen pers√∂nlicher Probleme und ich musste das ausbaden. [‚Ä¶] Mein letztes Treffen mit der Band fand am 8. Januar 2001 statt. Nachdem ich meinen Ausstieg verk√ºndet hatte, bin ich vor den anderen zusammengebrochen. Jeder im Raum weinte, die Spannung war unertr√§glich. Zum Schluss rief ich noch: ‚ÄöIch m√∂chte das nicht tun, aber ich muss, denn ich will mir selbst noch in die Augen sehen k√∂nnen.‚Äò‚Äú‚Äì Jason Newsted[10]Ohne einen Bassisten begann die Band im April 2001 auf dem Gel√§nde der ehemaligen Milit√§rkaserne Presidio mit den Vorbereitungen auf ein neues Studioalbum. Dabei wurde Metallica von den Filmemachern Joe Berlinger und Bruce Sinofsky begleitet, die innerhalb von zwei Jahren √ºber 1.000 Stunden Filmmaterial aufnahmen.[29] Durch st√§ndige Querelen zwischen Hetfield und Ulrich kam die Band nur langsam voran. Im Juli klinkte sich Hetfield aus und unterzog sich einer Rehabilitation, um seine Alkoholsucht zu therapieren. Der Entzug dauerte bis Dezember.[30] Etwa gleichzeitig bezog die Band in San Rafael ihr ‚ÄûHeadquarter‚Äú, ein Geb√§udekomplex, in dem sich Probe- und Aufnahmer√§ume sowie B√ºros befanden.St. Anger (2002‚Äì2005)Robert TrujilloMetallica begann mit Bob Rock als Bassisten die Aufnahmen f√ºr das achte Studioalbum St.&#160;Anger. Die sich bei den Bandmitgliedern aufgestaute Wut wurde in elf rohe, Hardcore-lastige Lieder kanalisiert. Auf Gitarrensoli wurde ganz verzichtet, w√§hrend Ulrichs Snare wie eine Timbale klingt. Nach Abschluss der Aufnahmen begann die Suche nach einem neuen Bassisten. Es spielten unter anderem Pepper Keenan (Corrosion of Conformity), Scott Reeder (Kyuss) und Jeordie White (Marilyn Manson) vor, die Wahl fiel jedoch auf den ehemaligen Suicidal-Tendencies- und Ozzy-Osbourne-Bassisten Robert Trujillo. Jason Newsted schloss sich der kanadischen Band Voivod an und spielte 2003 in Ozzy Osbournes Band w√§hrend der Ozzfest-Tournee.[31]Anl√§sslich des 20-j√§hrigen B√ºhnenjubil√§ums wurde die Band mit dem ‚ÄûmtvIcon‚Äú-Award geehrt. W√§hrend der einst√ºndigen Sendung interpretierten von Metallica beeinflusste Bands wie Korn, Staind, Limp Bizkit und Sum 41 sowie Snoop Dogg und Avril Lavigne Metallica-Lieder von verschiedenen Alben. Am Ende der Sendung trat Metallica zum ersten Mal mit Robert Trujillo auf und spielte ein Medley aus ‚ÄûHit the Lights‚Äú, ‚ÄûEnter Sandman‚Äú, ‚ÄûBlackened‚Äú, ‚ÄûCreeping Death‚Äú und ‚ÄûBattery‚Äú.[32] Im Mai 2003 wurde im Staatsgef√§ngnis San Quentin das Musikvideo f√ºr das Lied ‚ÄûSt. Anger‚Äú gedreht.St. Anger, ver√∂ffentlicht am 5. Juni 2003, entwickelte sich zum kontroversesten Album der Bandgeschichte. W√§hrend die einen den rohen Sound des Albums sch√§tzten, stie√ü St.&#160;Anger bei vielen Altfans auf Ablehnung. Dennoch erreichte das Album in √ºber 30 L√§ndern Platz eins der Albumcharts. Bei der folgenden ‚ÄûMadly in Anger‚Äú-Welttournee wurden mit Frantic und dem Titellied jedoch in der Regel nur zwei Lieder des Albums gespielt. Kurz vor dem Auftritt beim Download-Festival musste Lars Ulrich wegen starker Bauchschmerzen, die sich allerdings als harmlos herausstellten, in ein Z√ºrcher Krankenhaus eingeliefert werden. Metallica spielte ein verk√ºrztes Konzert, bei dem Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Joey Jordison (Slipknot) und Ulrichs Schlagzeugtechniker Flemming Larsen aushalfen.[33]Im Sommer 2004 standen zehn Alben von Metallica gleichzeitig in den schwedischen Albumcharts. Insgesamt nahm die Band im Jahr 2004 43&#160;Millionen Dollar ein und war damit nach Prince und Madonna der dritterfolgreichste Act in den USA.[10] Ebenfalls 2004 wurde der Dokumentarfilm Some Kind of Monster ver√∂ffentlicht, der w√§hrend der Aufnahmen zum St.-Anger-Album entstand. Im Jahre 2005 spielte Metallica lediglich zwei Konzerte als Vorgruppe der Rolling Stones in San Francisco.[34] Ein Jahr sp√§ter spielte die Band ihre ersten Konzerte in S√ºdafrika.Death Magnetic (2006‚Äì2010)Kirk HammettNachdem Bob Rock die letzten sechs Alben der Band produzierte, gab die Band im Februar 2006 bekannt, dass das n√§chste Studioalbum von Rick Rubin produziert werde. Rubin hatte sich als Produzent von K√ºnstlern wie AC/DC, Slayer, System of a Down, den Red Hot Chili Peppers und Johnny Cash einen Namen gemacht. Im Rahmen ihrer ‚ÄûEscape from the Studio&#160;‚Äô06‚Äú-Tour trat die Band im Juni 2006 zum dritten Mal bei den Festivals Rock am Ring / Rock im Park sowie auf der Berliner Waldb√ºhne auf. Dabei wurden zum zwanzigj√§hrigen Jubil√§um der Ver√∂ffentlichung des Albums Master of Puppets s√§mtliche darauf enthaltenen Lieder vorgetragen. In Berlin spielte Metallica zus√§tzlich ein unbetiteltes neues Lied.[35] Eine Zusammenstellung aller Musikvideos wurde unter dem Titel The Videos: 1989‚Äì2004 im Dezember 2006 als DVD ver√∂ffentlicht.Metallica nahm eine Coverversion des Liedes ‚ÄûThe Ecstasy of Gold‚Äú auf, das auf einem Tributalbum f√ºr den Komponisten Ennio Morricone ver√∂ffentlicht wurde. ‚ÄûThe Ecstasy of Gold‚Äú stammt aus dem Italo-Western Zwei glorreiche Halunken und wird seit 1983 als Intro f√ºr jedes Konzert verwendet.[36] Die Aufnahmen f√ºr das neunte Studioalbum Death Magnetic begannen im M√§rz 2007. Im Sommer des gleichen Jahres spielte Metallica eine kurze Stadiontournee durch Europa. Die Ank√ºndigung des Konzertes in der finnischen Hauptstadt Helsinki f√ºhrte dazu, dass sich Ende Mai 2007 zehn Metallica-Alben in den finnischen Albumcharts platzierten.[37] F√ºr den Iron-Maiden-Tributsampler Maiden Heaven nahm Metallica das Lied ‚ÄûRemember Tomorrow‚Äú auf, das f√ºr die Band eine Blaupause f√ºr Lieder wie ‚ÄûFade to Black‚Äú oder ‚ÄûWelcome Home (Sanitarium)‚Äú war.Am 2. September 2008, zehn Tage vor der geplanten Ver√∂ffentlichung, wurden in Frankreich irrt√ºmlicherweise die ersten Kopien des neuen Albums verkauft. Sofort tauchte das Album in den Internettauschb√∂rsen auf. Lars Ulrich blieb √ºber diesen vorzeitigen Leak gelassen und bezeichnete es als einen Erfolg, dass das Album erst zehn Tage vor der Ver√∂ffentlichung im Internet auftauchte.[38] Death Magnetic stieg weltweit in 32&#160;L√§ndern auf Platz eins der Albumcharts ein. In den USA schaffte Death Magnetic als f√ºnftes Metallica-Album den direkten Sprung auf Platz eins. Zuvor teilte sich Metallica mit den Beatles, U2 und der Dave Matthews Band den Rekord mit vier Alben.[39]Am Ver√∂ffentlichungstag wurde Death Magnetic in der Berliner Multifunktionshalle O‚ÇÇ World durch ein Konzert vorgestellt. Im Oktober 2008 begann die ‚ÄûWorld Magnetic‚Äú-Tour.vergr√∂√üern und Informationen zum Bild anzeigenPanorama des Ahoy Rotterdam w√§hrend der Death-Magnetic-Tour am 30. M√§rz 2009Am 4. April 2009 wurde Metallica in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame aufgenommen.[40] Erstmals seit der Trennung 2001 spielte Metallica sowohl Master of Puppets als auch Enter Sandman mit dem ehemaligen Bassisten Jason Newsted. Im April 2010 gewann Metallica den Revolver Golden God Award in der Kategorie ‚ÄûBeste Liveband‚Äú. Im Juni 2010 ging Metallica mit Slayer, Megadeth und Anthrax auf die The Big Four-Tournee. Am 29.&#160;Oktober 2010 erschien die auf dieser Tour entstandene DVD/Blu-ray The Big Four Live from Sofia, Bulgaria.Lulu und Hardwired... To Self-Destruct (seit 2011)Anl√§sslich der Aufnahme von Metallica in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame trat Metallica im Jahre 2009 unter anderem mit Lou Reed auf. Nach diesem Auftritt entstand die Idee, ein gemeinsames Album zu ver√∂ffentlichen. Am 31.&#160;Oktober 2011 wurde das Album Lulu weltweit ver√∂ffentlicht, erhielt aber √ºberwiegend schlechte Kritiken. Aufgrund der Eurokrise gab die Band Ende 2011 bekannt, ihre Tourpl√§ne zu √§ndern und verschiedene Auftritte vorzuverlegen. Bandmanager Cliff Burnstein erkl√§rte, dass man mit einer Schw√§chung des Euros in den kommenden Jahren rechne und daher Konzerte geben wolle, solange sie noch m√∂glichst profitabel seien. Daher w√ºrde Metallica 2012 und nicht wie geplant 2013 sein schwarzes Album bei verschiedenen Festivals in Europa spielen.[41]Am 14. Dezember 2011 ver√∂ffentlichte Metallica auf digitalem Wege die EP Beyond Magnetic, auf welche vier bis dato unver√∂ffentlichte Lieder aus den Death-Magnetic-Aufnahmen zu h√∂ren sind. Die Lieder wurden zuvor bei den vier Konzerten zum drei√üigj√§hrigen Bestehen der Band im Dezember 2011 in San Francisco erstmals live gespielt. Die Band arbeitete mit Nimr√≥d Antal an dem 3-D-Film Metallica Through the Never, welcher am 27.&#160;September 2013 ver√∂ffentlicht wurde. F√ºr den Film wurden unter anderem die Konzerte der Band im Sommer 2012 in Mexiko und Kanada gefilmt. Jedoch erwies sich der Film aufgrund niedriger Einnahmen als Flop.[42] Metallica steuerte f√ºr den Deep Purple-Tribute-Sampler Re-Machined: A Tribute to Deep Purple's Machine Head das Lied When a Blind Man Cries bei.Am 8. Dezember 2013 spielte Metallica als erste Band in der Antarktis. Somit sind sie die einzige Band der Welt, die innerhalb eines Jahres auf allen Kontinenten auftrat.[43]Am 26. Januar 2014 trat Metallica zusammen mit dem chinesischen Pianisten Lang Lang bei den Grammy Awards 2014 auf, wo sie gemeinsam das Lied One spielten.[44] Kurze Zeit sp√§ter wurde bekannt, dass Metallica f√ºr ein Ronnie-James-Dio-Tribute-Sampler ein Medley einiger seiner bekannten Rainbow-Hits gemacht hatten. Es soll zirka 9 Minuten dauern und Teile der Lieder A Light In The Black, Tarot Woman, Stargazer und Kill The King enthalten. Das Album wird This Is Your Life hei√üen.[45] Am 16. M√§rz 2014 trat Metallica in Bogot√° auf und stellte ihr neues Lied Lords of Summer vor. Auch wurde best√§tigt, dass voraussichtlich 2016 ein neues Studioalbum erscheinen werde. Bei den Terroranschl√§gen am 13. November 2015 in Paris starb Metallicas langj√§hriger Projektmanager in Frankreich, Thomas Ayad von Universal Music France, beim Massaker mit Geiselnahme im Bataclan.[46]Die Auftritts-Gagen f√ºr Metallica liegen im einstelligen Millionenbereich. Als Zugpferd f√ºr das von der DEAG veranstaltete Zwillingsfestival Rock im Revier und Rockavaria erhielt Metallica 7,3 Mio. US-Dollar (ca. 6,6 Mio. ‚Ç¨).[47]F√ºr den 18. November 2016 wurde ‚Äì acht Jahre nach Death Magnetic ‚Äì √ºber die Homepage der Band die Ver√∂ffentlichung des zehnten Studioalbums mit dem Titel Hardwired... To Self-Destruct angek√ºndigt: Es handelt sich um ein Doppelalbum mit zw√∂lf neuen Songs, wobei am 18. August 2016 das Lied Hardwired samt Musikvideo vorab als Single ausgekoppelt wurde. Gleichzeitig wurden die Tracklist und das Albumcover bekanntgegeben.RezeptionMetallica z√§hlt zu den einflussreichsten und erfolgreichsten Metal-Bands weltweit. Korn-S√§nger Jonathan Davis bezeichnet Metallica als seine Lieblingsband, da sie ‚Äûimmer ihren eigenen Weg gegangen und heute immer noch relevant ist‚Äú.[48] Laut Godsmack-Schlagzeuger Shannon Larkin stellt Metallica den gr√∂√üten Einfluss f√ºr seine Band dar. Larkin erkl√§rte, dass Metallica sein Leben ver√§nderte, als er 16 Jahre alt war, da er zuvor nie so etwas Hartes geh√∂rt hatte.[49] Die Trivium-Gitarristen Matthew Heafy und Corey Beaulieu erlernten ihr Instrument, nachdem sie zum ersten Mal mit der Musik von Metallica in Ber√ºhrung kamen.[50][51] Joey Z., der Gitarrist von Life of Agony, bezeichnet Kirk Hammett als sein Vorbild und gibt an, durch ihn zum Gitarre spielen gekommen zu sein.[52][53] F√ºr Avenged Sevenfold-S√§nger M. Shadows waren die gemeinsamen Konzerte der H√∂hepunkt der Musikerkarriere.[54] Armored Saint-S√§nger John Bush lobte Metallica daf√ºr, dass die Band ‚Äûeinen vorbildlichen Karriereweg gegangen ist und sich nie hat reinreden lassen‚Äú. F√ºr Kim Thayil von der Band Soundgarden ist Metallica ein ‚ÄûBeispiel f√ºr ehrlichen Erfolg ohne TV- und Radio-Hype‚Äú.[55]Das britische Rockmagazin Kerrang ver√∂ffentlichte im April 2006 ein Tributalbum mit dem Titel Master of Puppets: Remastered anl√§sslich des 20-j√§hrigen Jubil√§ums des Albums Master of Puppets. Das Album beinhaltet Coverversionen der acht Lieder durch Bands wie Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed und Trivium. Im Jahre 1996 ver√∂ffentlichte die finnische Band Apocalyptica ihr Deb√ºtalbum Plays Metallica By Four Cellos, auf dem acht Metallicalieder mit Celli gespielt werden. Die Parodieband Beatallica verbindet die Musik von Metallica mit der von den Beatles. Die Inhaber der musikalischen Rechte der Beatles, Sony, verklagte Beatallica, da die Band laut Sony einen ‚Äûsubstantiellen und irreparablen Schaden‚Äú zugef√ºgt habe. Lars Ulrich bat Metallicas Anwalt Peter Paterno, Beatallica rechtlichen Beistand zu leisten.[56]MTV platzierte Metallica in seiner Liste der ‚ÄûGr√∂√üten Metal-Bands aller Zeiten‚Äú auf Platz drei.[48] Der TV-Sender VH-1 setzte die Band auf Platz f√ºnf ihrer Liste der 100 gr√∂√üten Hard-Rock-Bands.[57] Das Album Master of Puppets belegte Platz eins in der Liste der ‚Äû100 besten Metalalben‚Äú vom Onlinemagazin Metal Rules.[58] In dem Buch Best of Rock &amp; Metal des deutschen Magazins Rock Hard, in dem die nach Meinung der Rock-Hard-Redaktion 500 st√§rksten Metal- und Hard-Rock-Alben aller Zeiten aufgef√ºhrt werden, ist Metallica mit f√ºnf Alben vertreten. Master of Puppets belegt Platz zwei, gefolgt von Ride the Lightning. Das Deb√ºtalbum Kill ‚ÄôEm All befindet sich auf Platz 12, das selbstbetitelte f√ºnfte Album auf Platz 79 sowie Garage Inc. auf Platz 500.[59]Die Spieleherstellerfirma Activision produzierte zusammen mit Neversoft einen Metallica-Ableger ihrer beliebten Musikspiele-Reihe Guitar Hero. In Guitar Hero: Metallica sind (Download Content nicht mitgerechnet) 31 Metallica-Lieder sowie 21 von der Band selbst bestimmte Gastlieder enthalten. Sowohl die Band selbst (die alle Animationen mit charakteristischen Posen und Bewegungen selbst per Motion Capture ins Spiel brachten) als auch die beiden Gaststars, King Diamond von Mercyful Fate und Lemmy Kilmister von Mot√∂rhead, sind spielbare Charaktere. Das Spiel erschien am 22. Mai 2009 in Europa f√ºr Sony Playstation 2, Playstation 3, X-Box 360 und Nintendo Wii.

O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva (Foto: Aloisio Mauricio / Fotoarena)A Pol&#237;cia Federal indiciou o ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva pelo crime de corrup&#231;&#227;o em raz&#227;o de evid&#234;ncias de propina de R$ 20 milh&#245;es mascarada em contratos da empreiteira Odebrecht,&#160;em Angola, firmados com a empresa Exergia, cujo s&#243;cio era Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, seu sobrinho.Lula foi indiciado por corrup&#231;&#227;o passiva, porque a PF concluiu que os contratos de Taiguara s&#243; aconteceram em raz&#227;o do parentesco e das rela&#231;&#245;es da empreiteira com Lula, al&#233;m dos documentos que citam o pr&#243;prio ex-presidente no neg&#243;cio. Seu sobrinho e sete executivos da empreiteira, incluindo Marcelo Odebrecht, foram indiciados por corrup&#231;&#227;o e lavagem.Leia tamb&#233;m:&gt;&gt;&#160;As opera&#231;&#245;es suspeitas da Odebrecht em Angola&gt;&gt; Palocci, o Italiano, a Odebrecht e o PTO indiciamento ocorreu ap&#243;s cinco meses de investiga&#231;&#227;o da Opera&#231;&#227;o Janus, que devassou contratos da empreiteira com a empresa Exergia. Em maio, a PF, com autoriza&#231;&#227;o da Justi&#231;a, cumpriu mandados de busca e apreens&#227;o em endere&#231;os de Taiguara em Santos. Era uma mina de ouro para a investiga&#231;&#227;o. A PF descobriu que Lula recebia tr&#234;s alcunhas nas conversas: tio, presidente e &#8220;chefe maior&#8221;.Uma das provas apreendidas pela PF era uma esp&#233;cie de di&#225;rio no computador do sobrinho de Lula, com diversos relatos da empresa e do petista. Eram textos em formato .doc, com Taiguara falando de si mesmo em terceira pessoa. Um dos primeiros &#8211; e mais relevantes &#8211; registros desse di&#225;rio &#233; de 2009, quando Taiguara descreve uma reuni&#227;o. Ele diz que esteve em Bras&#237;lia para conversar com o tio. Registrou at&#233; a dura&#231;&#227;o do encontro: 50 minutos. Taiguara resumiu a resposta de Lula dizendo que ele deu &#8220;carta branca&#8221; para os neg&#243;cios em Angola.Ap&#243;s esse encontro, com o aval de Lula, Taiguara preparou sua empresa para arrancar um naco dos contratos bilion&#225;rios da Odebrecht em Angola, financiados com dinheiro do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social). Como &#201;POCA revelou no ano passado, Lula fazia lobby para a empreiteira sob o pretexto de palestras, usando o status de ex-presidente para viabilizar obras fora do pa&#237;s bancadas pelo banco estatal.Pagamento da Odebrecht para a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)Contrato da Odebrecht com a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)O tio resolveAl&#233;m do di&#225;rio, a PF conseguiu recuperar mensagens de WhatsApp enviadas por Taiguara. Um dos destinat&#225;rios favoritos era um seguran&#231;a do ex-presidente Lula, de nome Valmir Morais. Funcion&#225;rio da Presid&#234;ncia da Rep&#250;blica, ele acompanhava Lula ap&#243;s o mandato. Como &#201;POCA revelou no in&#237;cio deste ano, Valmir era um dos seguran&#231;as que foram 111 vezes a Atibaia, no s&#237;tio que Lula diz n&#227;o ser dele. A PF descobriu que o seguran&#231;a era, tamb&#233;m, um homem de recados do ex-presidente, que n&#227;o usava celular. Numa das mensagens, Taiguara disse que havia chegado de Angola e precisava, com urg&#234;ncia, de uma reuni&#227;o com o tio.Outro lote de mensagens era com um parceiro de Taiguara em sua empresa, a Exergia. O conte&#250;do das conversas era expl&#237;cito. Numa delas, Taiguara fala que um projeto com a Odebrecht era uma fic&#231;&#227;o &#8211; o contrato depois foi firmado. Em outra, j&#225; em 2015, eles reclamavam das dificuldades em fechar neg&#243;cios. Na ocasi&#227;o, a Lava Jato j&#225; tinha atingido a empreiteira. Taiguara, de novo, ia direto ao ponto: ia falar com o tio para resolver os impasses com a Odebrecht.&#160;No total, foram 16 contratos da Odebrecht com a empresa de Taiguara, uma parceria pr&#243;spera, longa e diversificada. A conclus&#227;o da PF &#233; contundente: a empresa foi criada apenas para receber dinheiro da empreiteira, sem prestar servi&#231;os. N&#227;o havia outros clientes ou ind&#237;cios de qualquer servi&#231;o executado. Sobram, contudo, documentos que mostram uma gastan&#231;a de Taiguara, incluindo outros familiares de Lula, que tinham at&#233; o plano de sa&#250;de pago com o dinheiro da Exergia. Havia, claro, itens de luxo, como roupas e carros.Conforme os documentos eram analisados, a investiga&#231;&#227;o avan&#231;ava. Uma per&#237;cia concluiu pela &#8220;incapacidade t&#233;cnica e operacional&#8221; da Exergia. Soma-se a um documento interno da Odebrecht, que qualificava o servi&#231;o contratado de &#8220;imprest&#225;vel&#8221;. A conclus&#227;o da PF foi uma s&#243;: era imposs&#237;vel a nanica empresa de Santos executar as obras milion&#225;rias em Angola.As mensagens de Taiguara citando Lula n&#227;o eram mera bravata de um familiar se aproveitando do status de um parente famoso. A investiga&#231;&#227;o descobriu ainda diversas reuni&#245;es de Taiguara no Instituto Lula. Houve, tamb&#233;m, um encontro num hotel cinco estrelas em Angola. O primeiro ind&#237;cio surgiu de uma mensagem do pr&#243;prio Taiguara a um seguran&#231;a de Lula. Ele pedia um encontro, informava que estava no mesmo hotel do tio e citava o quarto. Lula esteve l&#225; duas vezes, sob o pretexto de dar palestras. As duas foram pagas pela Odebrecht.O empres&#225;rio Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, filho do irm&#227;o da primeira mulher de Lula, em depoimento &#224; CPI do BNDES em outubro de 2015 (Foto: Lucio Bernardo Junior / C&#226;mara dos Deputados)Procurada, a defesa de Lula enviou a seguinte nota por meio do Instituto Lula:O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva tem sua vida investigada h&#225; 40 anos, teve todas as suas contas e de seus familiares devassadas, seu sigilo banc&#225;rio, fiscal e telef&#244;nico quebrado&#160; e n&#227;o foi encontrada nenhuma irregularidade. Lula n&#227;o ocupa mais nenhum cargo p&#250;blico desde 1&#186; de janeiro de 2011, e sempre agiu dentro da lei antes, durante e depois de ocupar dois mandatos eleitos como presidente da Rep&#250;blica. A defesa do ex-presidente ir&#225; analisar o documento da Pol&#237;cia Federal, vazado para a imprensa e divulgado com sensacionalismo antes do acesso da defesa, porque essa pr&#225;tica deixa claro que n&#227;o s&#227;o processos s&#233;rios de investiga&#231;&#227;o, e sim uma campanha de massacre midi&#225;tico para produzir manchetes na imprensa e tentar destruir a imagem do ex-presidente mais popular da hist&#243;ria do pa&#237;s.&#160;&#201;POCA ainda n&#227;o localizou os advogados de Taiguara, mas t&#227;o logo obtenha um posicionamento atualizar&#225; esta reportagem para contemplar adequadamente a vers&#227;o dos citados. Na CPI do BNDES, ele disse que n&#227;o houve influ&#234;ncia de Lula no neg&#243;cio.No papel, Taiguara nem sequer &#233; sobrinho de Lula. Ele &#233; filho de Jacinto Ribeiro dos Santos, o Lambari, amigo de Lula e irm&#227;o da primeira mulher do ex-presidente, j&#225; morta. Mas o parentesco a&#237; se deu por afinidade. E a Odebrecht cimentou essa rela&#231;&#227;o.

Sob o apelido de Italiano&#8221;, o duplamente ex-ministro Antonio Palocci &#233; um dos personagens mais ativos nas atividades subterr&#226;neas da empreiteira Odebrecht no per&#237;odo dos tr&#234;s governos petistas. &#8220;Italiano&#8221; aparece em tratativas da empreiteira para obter contratos com a Petrobras, na edi&#231;&#227;o de uma Medida Provis&#243;ria para a concess&#227;o de benef&#237;cios tribut&#225;rios para a empresa (que deu errado), no programa de desenvolvimento do submarino nuclear, em negocia&#231;&#245;es para obten&#231;&#227;o de um financiamento do Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social (BNDES) e at&#233; um projeto de constru&#231;&#227;o de uma nova sede para o Instituto Lula. Tudo isso era feito em troca de propina. E muita propina. De acordo com os investigadores que deflagaram nesta segunda-feira (26) a Opera&#231;&#227;o Omert&#225;, a 35&#170; fase da Lava Jato, por Palocci correram cerca de R$ 128 milh&#245;es sujos da empreiteira para o PT.Antonio Palocci deixa a sede da PF em S&#227;o Paulo em van com presos na opera&#231;&#227;o. (Foto: Paulo Lisboa/Brazil Photo Press / Ag&#234;ncia O Globo)Palocci era a principal liga&#231;&#227;o da Odebrecht com o governo Lula. No &#8220;Setor de Opera&#231;&#245;es Estruturadas&#8221; da Odebrecht havia, inclusive, uma planilha em formato xls com o t&#237;tulo &#8220;Posi&#231;&#227;o Italiano&#8221;. A descoberta deste setor, em fase anterior da Lava Jato, foi decisiva para a queda de Palocci. O setor era um departamento clandestino dentro da empresa, encarregado de administrar o pagamento de propina. Nele, os investigadores descobriram planilhas e e-mails nos quais os diretores da empreiteira tratavam de pagamentos il&#237;citos. Os pol&#237;ticos eram tratados por seus nomes ou apelidos. Por algum tempo, os investigadores se debru&#231;aram para saber se &#8220;Italiano&#8221; era Guido Mantega ou Palocci. As investiga&#231;&#245;es mostraram que Mantega tamb&#233;m se envolveu na corrup&#231;&#227;o da Lava Jato, mas o &#8220;Italiano&#8221; era Palocci.Palocci era pr&#243;ximo de Marcelo Odebercht, a ponto de os dois se encontrarem com frequ&#234;ncia na sede da Projeto, a consultoria que, ao ser descoberta em 2011, derrubou Palocci do cargo de ministro-chefe da Casa Civil de Dilma Rousseff. O caso da Medida Provis&#243;ria 460 &#233; simb&#243;lico. Odebrecht relata encontros em 2009 com o ent&#227;o deputado Palocci, para obter a aprova&#231;&#227;o de medida que reduziria a zero a cobran&#231;a de Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI). Odebrecht enviou ao auxiliar de Palocci, Branislav Kontic, e-mails com argumentos favor&#225;veis &#224; aprova&#231;&#227;o da medida. N&#227;o deu certo. Mesmo aprovada, a medida foi derrubada pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal. Segundo Marcelo Odebrecht, Palocci lhe disse que seu desafeto e sucessor no Minist&#233;rio da Fazenda, Guido Mantega, &#8220;teria manipulado informa&#231;&#245;es&#8221; para que o ent&#227;o presidente Lula vetasse pontos da Medida Provis&#243;ria ou at&#233; mesmo influenciasse a decis&#227;o do Supremo. Quando a opera&#231;&#227;o deu errado, Palocci tentou ajudar a Odebrecht a compensar a perda com novos contratos com a Petrobras.A Opera&#231;&#227;o Omert&#225; mostrou uma liga&#231;&#227;o mais extensa do PT com a Odebrecht e, mais ainda, de Palocci com a empreiteira. Ministro duas vezes, sempre derrubado por den&#250;ncias de corrup&#231;&#227;o, o Italiano &#233; tratado como um homem de confian&#231;a da empresa para conversar com o PT, o governo Lula e tratar de contribui&#231;&#245;es para campanhas eleitorais. Agora, Palocci e Marcelo Odebrecht dividem a mesma situa&#231;&#227;o, a de presos em Curitiba. O advogado de Palocci, Jos&#233; Roberto Batocchio, afirma que Palocci nunca recebeu &#8220;vantagens indevidas&#8221;. A defesa de Branislav diz que ele n&#227;o cometeu nenhum ato il&#237;cito, nem recebeu nenhuma vantagem il&#237;cita.&#160;                                                                                                                                                                                  TAGS                                                                                                                                                                  	                                            MAIS LIDAS

O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva (Foto: Aloisio Mauricio / Fotoarena)A Pol&#237;cia Federal indiciou o ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva pelo crime de corrup&#231;&#227;o em raz&#227;o de evid&#234;ncias de propina de R$ 20 milh&#245;es mascarada em contratos da empreiteira Odebrecht,&#160;em Angola, firmados com a empresa Exergia, cujo s&#243;cio era Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, seu sobrinho.Lula foi indiciado por corrup&#231;&#227;o passiva, porque a PF concluiu que os contratos de Taiguara s&#243; aconteceram em raz&#227;o do parentesco e das rela&#231;&#245;es da empreiteira com Lula, al&#233;m dos documentos que citam o pr&#243;prio ex-presidente no neg&#243;cio. Seu sobrinho e sete executivos da empreiteira, incluindo Marcelo Odebrecht, foram indiciados por corrup&#231;&#227;o e lavagem.Leia tamb&#233;m:&gt;&gt;&#160;As opera&#231;&#245;es suspeitas da Odebrecht em Angola&gt;&gt; Palocci, o Italiano, a Odebrecht e o PTO indiciamento ocorreu ap&#243;s cinco meses de investiga&#231;&#227;o da Opera&#231;&#227;o Janus, que devassou contratos da empreiteira com a empresa Exergia. Em maio, a PF, com autoriza&#231;&#227;o da Justi&#231;a, cumpriu mandados de busca e apreens&#227;o em endere&#231;os de Taiguara em Santos. Era uma mina de ouro para a investiga&#231;&#227;o. A PF descobriu que Lula recebia tr&#234;s alcunhas nas conversas: tio, presidente e &#8220;chefe maior&#8221;.Uma das provas apreendidas pela PF era uma esp&#233;cie de di&#225;rio no computador do sobrinho de Lula, com diversos relatos da empresa e do petista. Eram textos em formato .doc, com Taiguara falando de si mesmo em terceira pessoa. Um dos primeiros &#8211; e mais relevantes &#8211; registros desse di&#225;rio &#233; de 2009, quando Taiguara descreve uma reuni&#227;o. Ele diz que esteve em Bras&#237;lia para conversar com o tio. Registrou at&#233; a dura&#231;&#227;o do encontro: 50 minutos. Taiguara resumiu a resposta de Lula dizendo que ele deu &#8220;carta branca&#8221; para os neg&#243;cios em Angola.Ap&#243;s esse encontro, com o aval de Lula, Taiguara preparou sua empresa para arrancar um naco dos contratos bilion&#225;rios da Odebrecht em Angola, financiados com dinheiro do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico e Social). Como &#201;POCA revelou no ano passado, Lula fazia lobby para a empreiteira sob o pretexto de palestras, usando o status de ex-presidente para viabilizar obras fora do pa&#237;s bancadas pelo banco estatal.Pagamento da Odebrecht para a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)Contrato da Odebrecht com a empresa do sobrinho de Lula (Foto: Reprodu&#231;&#227;o)O tio resolveAl&#233;m do di&#225;rio, a PF conseguiu recuperar mensagens de WhatsApp enviadas por Taiguara. Um dos destinat&#225;rios favoritos era um seguran&#231;a do ex-presidente Lula, de nome Valmir Morais. Funcion&#225;rio da Presid&#234;ncia da Rep&#250;blica, ele acompanhava Lula ap&#243;s o mandato. Como &#201;POCA revelou no in&#237;cio deste ano, Valmir era um dos seguran&#231;as que foram 111 vezes a Atibaia, no s&#237;tio que Lula diz n&#227;o ser dele. A PF descobriu que o seguran&#231;a era, tamb&#233;m, um homem de recados do ex-presidente, que n&#227;o usava celular. Numa das mensagens, Taiguara disse que havia chegado de Angola e precisava, com urg&#234;ncia, de uma reuni&#227;o com o tio.Outro lote de mensagens era com um parceiro de Taiguara em sua empresa, a Exergia. O conte&#250;do das conversas era expl&#237;cito. Numa delas, Taiguara fala que um projeto com a Odebrecht era uma fic&#231;&#227;o &#8211; o contrato depois foi firmado. Em outra, j&#225; em 2015, eles reclamavam das dificuldades em fechar neg&#243;cios. Na ocasi&#227;o, a Lava Jato j&#225; tinha atingido a empreiteira. Taiguara, de novo, ia direto ao ponto: ia falar com o tio para resolver os impasses com a Odebrecht.&#160;No total, foram 16 contratos da Odebrecht com a empresa de Taiguara, uma parceria pr&#243;spera, longa e diversificada. A conclus&#227;o da PF &#233; contundente: a empresa foi criada apenas para receber dinheiro da empreiteira, sem prestar servi&#231;os. N&#227;o havia outros clientes ou ind&#237;cios de qualquer servi&#231;o executado. Sobram, contudo, documentos que mostram uma gastan&#231;a de Taiguara, incluindo outros familiares de Lula, que tinham at&#233; o plano de sa&#250;de pago com o dinheiro da Exergia. Havia, claro, itens de luxo, como roupas e carros.Conforme os documentos eram analisados, a investiga&#231;&#227;o avan&#231;ava. Uma per&#237;cia concluiu pela &#8220;incapacidade t&#233;cnica e operacional&#8221; da Exergia. Soma-se a um documento interno da Odebrecht, que qualificava o servi&#231;o contratado de &#8220;imprest&#225;vel&#8221;. A conclus&#227;o da PF foi uma s&#243;: era imposs&#237;vel a nanica empresa de Santos executar as obras milion&#225;rias em Angola.As mensagens de Taiguara citando Lula n&#227;o eram mera bravata de um familiar se aproveitando do status de um parente famoso. A investiga&#231;&#227;o descobriu ainda diversas reuni&#245;es de Taiguara no Instituto Lula. Houve, tamb&#233;m, um encontro num hotel cinco estrelas em Angola. O primeiro ind&#237;cio surgiu de uma mensagem do pr&#243;prio Taiguara a um seguran&#231;a de Lula. Ele pedia um encontro, informava que estava no mesmo hotel do tio e citava o quarto. Lula esteve l&#225; duas vezes, sob o pretexto de dar palestras. As duas foram pagas pela Odebrecht.O empres&#225;rio Taiguara Rodrigues dos Santos, filho do irm&#227;o da primeira mulher de Lula, em depoimento &#224; CPI do BNDES em outubro de 2015 (Foto: Lucio Bernardo Junior / C&#226;mara dos Deputados)Procurada, a defesa de Lula enviou a seguinte nota por meio do Instituto Lula:O ex-presidente Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva tem sua vida investigada h&#225; 40 anos, teve todas as suas contas e de seus familiares devassadas, seu sigilo banc&#225;rio, fiscal e telef&#244;nico quebrado&#160; e n&#227;o foi encontrada nenhuma irregularidade. Lula n&#227;o ocupa mais nenhum cargo p&#250;blico desde 1&#186; de janeiro de 2011, e sempre agiu dentro da lei antes, durante e depois de ocupar dois mandatos eleitos como presidente da Rep&#250;blica. A defesa do ex-presidente ir&#225; analisar o documento da Pol&#237;cia Federal, vazado para a imprensa e divulgado com sensacionalismo antes do acesso da defesa, porque essa pr&#225;tica deixa claro que n&#227;o s&#227;o processos s&#233;rios de investiga&#231;&#227;o, e sim uma campanha de massacre midi&#225;tico para produzir manchetes na imprensa e tentar destruir a imagem do ex-presidente mais popular da hist&#243;ria do pa&#237;s.&#160;&#201;POCA ainda n&#227;o localizou os advogados de Taiguara, mas t&#227;o logo obtenha um posicionamento atualizar&#225; esta reportagem para contemplar adequadamente a vers&#227;o dos citados. Na CPI do BNDES, ele disse que n&#227;o houve influ&#234;ncia de Lula no neg&#243;cio.No papel, Taiguara nem sequer &#233; sobrinho de Lula. Ele &#233; filho de Jacinto Ribeiro dos Santos, o Lambari, amigo de Lula e irm&#227;o da primeira mulher do ex-presidente, j&#225; morta. Mas o parentesco a&#237; se deu por afinidade. E a Odebrecht cimentou essa rela&#231;&#227;o.

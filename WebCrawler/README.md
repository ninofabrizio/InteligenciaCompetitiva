#A (simple) Web Crawler in Java

The objective is to make a Web Crawler that gets the content of a link and stores it's body in a text file. Then it stores different links that the original one makes reference in a different text file. In the end, it leaves a single text file that contains all the info it got previously organized.

Made using the Eclipse IDE in Java 1.8.0.

## Known issues:

- Sometimes, connection errors may happen. I'm not sure if this is due to problems with Internet connection or
that I'm just asking too much commands to the servers I connect to and they prevent me of continuing.
